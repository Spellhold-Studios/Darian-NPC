@2    = ~ToB is required to install Darian~
@3    = ~With Alaundo's Prophecy concluded, Darian returned home to Myrrhavin at last. Contrary to his own expectations, Darian was celebrated amongst the Avariel as a true hero and was granted the highest honors of that enigmatic race. Although he initially resumed his station as a Talon, Darian soon found that he had seen enough death, and retired. The decades afterward were confusing ones for the Avariel knight as he tried and failed to find some new purpose in life. Eventually, weary of his fame and accomplishments from his time at <CHARNAME>'s side bringing him and his people undue attention from outside forces, Darian left his people to wander the Realms in solitude. In time, he became known as a wandering saint or even oracle, and many young adventurers sought him for his counsel. What Darian thought of this is unknown, for he spoke less and less as time went on, becoming increasingly cryptic and, many said, saddened over some unspoken burden. Eventually, Darian became impossible for any to find, on Faerun or the planes. Some day he found a place to stay where none could find him, others hold that he stepped through a portal to some time or place beyond. The truth, and Darian's ultimate fate, remain a mystery to this day.~
@4    = ~Human history speaks little of Darian after <CHARNAME>'s ascension to the gods, as he swiftly disappeared from the public view after the cataclysmic final battle. Returning home to his people, Darian rejected the honors bestowed upon him and returned to service as the Talon initiate he had once been. This did not last long, and Darian found he had a gift for leadership and planning in the years to come, a gift that would serve him well as a rising young officer. In time, he became a famed general and celebrated hero of the Avariel, with a legendary disdain for even the most daunting odds. He attributed this often justified confidence to his adventures with <CHARNAME> and the impossible odds they had so often faced together, often remarking that if a handful of idiots could slay would-be gods, trained soldiers should have little trouble. Curiously, Darian actively rejected any association with <CHARNAME>'s new but energetic church, and indeed denied any knowledge of the goddess calling herself <CHARNAME>. Of his former lover, Darian said only that she died in the final battle against Amelyssan.~

In time, he became a famed general and celebrated hero of the Avariel, with a legendary disdain for even the most daunting odds. His career was interrupted, however, by the arrival of a strange woman some decades after the final battle against Amelyssan. Clearly part Avariel, but also part divine, she claimed to be Darian's daughter. Due to the complicated situation of her conception, birth, and her mother's ascension, her divine nature had been revoked and she had been sent to her father's care. Shunning all association with <CHARNAME>'s young church, Darian raised his semi-immortal daughter alone amidst the clouds. Despite - or perhaps because of - Darian's best efforts, his daughter had the same drive in life as her mother and the quiet determination of her father, and to catalogue her adventures in life would require a tome of her own. Or three.~
@6    = ~The years following Amelyssan's defeat were difficult ones for Darian. <CHARNAME> had challenged his preconceptions of the world and his beliefs, but facing a world that knew him mainly as <CHARNAME>'s lover was another matter entirely. Despite the best of intentions and a hopeful future with <CHARNAME>, Darian steadily grew more withdrawn and bitter as the years went on, refusing to appear in public and often vanishing entirely for long stretches of time. Eventually, the pressure and emotional stress proved too much, and Darian quietly fled <CHARNAME> and human civilization entirely. He returned home in disgrace, having brought unwelcome attention to the winged elves and having forsaken his responsibilities as a Talon. Perhaps in an act of penance, Darian began patrolling the cloud-shrouded mountains in solitude, away from Avariel and earth-bound alike. It is believed he keeps his quiet vigil still, a place and role he can finally call home.~

@8    = ~With Bhaal's legacy laid to rest, Darian took his leave of <CHARNAME> and returned home to Myrrhavin. Deciding he had seen enough death for a lifetime, Darian left the Talon order with the intent of never bloodying his hands again. Fate had other plans, however, and in the years to come Darian reluctantly took up arms again. His actions at <CHARNAME>'s side had brought the Avariel an unfortunate amount of attention from outsiders, friendly and otherwise. Taking responsibility for the consequences of his actions, Darian was ultimately to prove equal parts warrior and diplomat in the decades after Amelyssan's defeat, ever standing between the Avariel and outsiders, and it surprised him as much as anyone when he eventually wed an earth-bound elf who dreamed of reuniting the fractured elven races. When asked of <CHARNAME>, however, Darian answered that one of his greatest regrets in life was that he was not the man <CHARNAME> had so richly deserved.~

A less-welcome surprise came not long afterwards, when a half-Avariel woman found Myrrhavin, claiming to be searching for her father. The reconciliation of Darian and his daughter would be neither swift nor easy, and nearly destroy the tentative happiness he had since found. Darian regretted that he had not been the man <CHARNAME> had so deserved, nor the father his daughter deserved. In the end, legend has it, they did find some sort of rapprochement, but never saw each other again after the young woman left Myrrhavin a few years after she arrived.~
@10   = ~For good and ill, Darian was true to his word after Amelyssan's defeat. Although he was welcomed home in Myrrhavin with great ceremony, Darian stepped down from the Talon order to fulfill his promise to <CHARNAME>, taking time to think and reflect on the extraordinary events he witnessed in Amn and Tethyr. More important still were the people he had known, and his often troubled relationships with them. <CHARNAME> in particular was a difficult subject, and Darian ultimately realized that while he did indeed have passionate feelings for her, he could never be happy in her world, nor she in his. What passed between Darian and <CHARNAME> one winter's eve some years after Bhaal's legacy was laid to rest is not known, but Darian left as quietly and swiftly as he had arrived. He never returned to the civilizations of the earth-bound races, and what eventually became of him is not known to human history.~

He returned on occasion for the sake of his son, whom he tried to be as good a father to as circumstances allowed, but they never grew close. Yet in the end, the half-Avariel boy took after his father more than anyone save <CHARNAME> realized, and the boy who became one of Faerun's more illustrious paladins was very much his father's son.~
@12   = ~With Bhaal's legacy laid to rest, Darian proved as good as his word. He had grown considerably since he left Myrrhavin, and returned home a different man. He stepped down from the Talon order, deciding he had seen enough death already, and began to think on his adventures at <CHARNAME>'s side, and his often troubled relationships with his former companions. It was some years after Amelyssan's defeat when Darian returned to <CHARNAME> and admitted that living without her was one of the most difficult experiences of his life. They agreed to start over, and though their courtship was not without its share of difficulties, their love would stand the test of time and be celebrated by bards for decades to come. After their wedding, Darian was content to step out of the public view and turn his keen mind towards scholarly pursuits rather than martial. Even today, Darian's account of <CHARNAME>'s adventures and those she encountered along the way is widely considered the definitive history of Bhaal's legacy.~

@14   = ~Ironically, Darian proved he did not share Aerie's lust for adventure and quest for justice in the years following Amelyssan's defeat. The death and bloodshed he had witnessed and helped cause in Amn and Tethyr weighed heavily on him, and when he and Aerie started a family, Darian retired to Myrrhavin with their children to raise and teach them away from the battlefield. Fatherhood, he discovered, was both a great responsibility and healing work, mending the emotional scars from his adventures. Despite not sharing his beloved Aerie's taste for adventure, Darian proved an anchor to her in the centuries to come, a faithful and unyielding bulwark against the trials of her path in life. Ultimately, he passed away only days after Aerie, content that despite all odds, Faerun may have been a better place for his deeds. ~
@15   = ~Fate was kind to Aerie after Amelyssan's defeat. Together with Darian, Aerie set out to adventure in her own right, no longer timid or fearful of what the future held. A proper telling of all of Aerie's adventures and achievements is a tale in its own right, but in the centuries to come her name would rival <CHARNAME>'s as one of the great heroes of their time. Not even her eventual marriage to Darian and subsequent children could hold Aerie back from her thirst for adventure and justice, to the point that her husband claimed she was addicted to the excitement of it all. Astonishingly, it was not battle but old age that eventually claimed Aerie, surrounded on her death bed by friends, family, and, some said, Aerdrie Faeyna herself.~
