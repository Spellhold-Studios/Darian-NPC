@0    = ~To be buried beneath the earth for all time... my skin crawls just thinking about it.~
@1    = ~If I had known my mission would demand this, I would have told my commander to go straight to hell. I'll be alright, <CHARNAME>, but we need to find a way out. Fast.~
@2    = ~Well, this is different. And nerve-wracking.~
@3    = ~A swamp. A filthy, insect-filled swamp. Why do the druids love this place, again?~
@4    = ~What are you doing, <CHARNAME>?~
@5    = ~Excuse me?~
@6    = ~What do you mean, "what am I doing"?~
@7    = ~Nothing that concerns you, Darian. Go away.~
@8    = ~So be it.~
@9    = ~Just what exactly are you trying to do, <CHARNAME>? You told me you were seeking to rescue a friend of yours, but as far as I can tell, you haven't even begun looking for her.~
@10   = ~Haven't even begun? What gives you the right to pass judgement on my actions?~
@11   = ~For your information, I actually am trying damn hard to rescue Imoen - it's not a simple matter of breaking into some castle. I'm working to purchase the aid of a group that's offered to help me.~
@12   = ~You're lucky I care more about rescuing Imoen than I do about what you think of me.~
@13   = ~Personally, I couldn't care less about your actions. It is the motives behind them that concern me.~
@14   = ~And what makes you think I'm going to tell you?~
@15   = ~My motives are none of your damn business, Darian.~
@16   = ~Too bad. We're done talking.~
@17   = ~Hmph. Just what I expected from a <PRO_RACE>.~
@18   = ~I don't know what your problem is, but you had better start fixing it before I get violent.~
@19   = ~I'm swiftly running out of patience with you, Darian. You had better change your attitude, and soon.~
@20   = ~If you think so poorly of me, then why the hell did you offer to help?~
@21   = ~You're not the only one wondering...~
@22   = ~So you yourself have no idea what you're really trying to do, and are hoping a group of people whose identity you don't even know will help you? Even for a <PRO_RACE>, that's bad.~
@23   = ~You're a real charmer, Darian. For your sake, I hope you get off your high horse before someone decides to make the world a better place by removing you from it.~
@24   = ~I'd like to see you do better, high and mighty Talon.~
@25   = ~Oh, that's rich. No wonder you were in Athkatla by yourself.~
@26   = ~Now that is something I can respect. You have more backbone than I would have expected from a <PRO_RACE>.~
@27   = ~If you would like your head to continue its close acquaintance with your neck, I would suggest you learn about something called "kindness".~
@28   = ~Your attitude will determine your lifespan, Darian. At the moment, the latter is looking brief and painful.~
@29   = ~Then why on earth are you helping me?~
@30   = ~<CHARNAME>, if you don't mind, I would like to... apologize for what I said when we last spoke.~
@31   = ~I think I said some things in haste as well, Darian. Please, go ahead.~
@32   = ~This had better be good...~
@33   = ~An apology? From you? This is certainly unexpected.~
@34   = ~Keep your apology. I have no desire to talk to you.~
@35   = ~Very well.~
@36   = ~My behavior was out of line. You are not an ordinary <PRO_RACE>, and even if you were, I should not have treated you like that. You did help me with my assignment to Athkatla, and deserve to be treated with civility, not hostility. I am... sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@37   = ~I accept your apology. But why were you so hostile in the first place?~
@38   = ~I suppose I'll accept that. But what was with that attitude you had?~
@39   = ~I don't know if I can accept that, Darian. I don't know why you were so hostile to begin with.~
@40   = ~Why should I trust you? You clearly don't trust me.~
@41   = ~Nice try, but I think I already saw the real you, and no amount of fake apology will erase it.~
@42   = ~It isn't an easy thing for me to explain, especially to a <PRO_RACE>, and I don't know if I could give you any answer you would find truly satisfactory. Perhaps in the future, I'll be able to tell you, but for now, please accept my apology.~
@43   = ~I don't think I can trust you, Darian, but I will accept that.~
@44   = ~But how can I trust someone who clearly doesn't trust me?~
@45   = ~The apology was one thing, but this is ridiculous. I'm not going to let you buy time to make up a convincing story.~
@46   = ~You can't. And I certainly wouldn't, in your position. But... it's all I can offer you.~
@47   = ~Then I accept. Some things just come in time.~
@48   = ~I think I understand. And that's good enough for me.~
@49   = ~I just don't know, Darian... but I'll accept that, for now.~
@50   = ~Then I refuse.~
@51   = ~...Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@52   = ~<CHARNAME>, may I ask you something?~
@53   = ~Stay away from <CHARNAME>, Darian. You have proven yourself incapable of speaking to anyone in a civil fashion, and I will not have you speak ill to her.~
@54   = ~My business with <CHARNAME> is none of yours.~
@55   = ~I'm looking out for her well-being, where you have never shown the slightest hint of concern for anyone else.~
@56   = ~Be that as it may, I do wish to speak with her.~
@57   = ~If she wishes to speak to you, I will respect her wish. But I'm keeping my eye on you.~
@58   = ~So be it. <CHARNAME>, I wish to speak with you.~
@59   = ~Of course. What's on your mind?~
@60   = ~If this won't take up too much time, sure.~
@61   = ~Sorry, this really isn't a good time.~
@62   = ~As you wish.~
@63   = ~Why did you help me?~
@64   = ~What do you mean by that?~
@65   = ~I'm not sure what you mean, Darian.~
@66   = ~You're not really asking me just why I helped you, are you? You're asking why a <PRO_RACE> helped an Avariel.~
@67   = ~Why would you help an Avariel? I wouldn't have imagined that any of your kind would risk harm to help one of my people.~
@68   = ~When I see someone who needs help, I give it, regardless of circumstances.~
@69   = ~Why would I not help you? Is the fact that you're an Avariel supposed to change anything?~
@70   = ~Any reason I shouldn't have?~
@71   = ~You're such an exotic, handsome man. Good enough reason for me.~
@72   = ~No one should live in a cage, Darian. Not an orc, not an Avariel.~
@73   = ~You're very perceptive. That was indeed what I meant. So, why did you help me?~
@74   = ~Because you're such an exotic, handsome man.~
@75   = ~Er... whatever your reasons, I think I may have misjudged you.~
@76   = ~Aw, are you blushing?~
@77   = ~I probably shouldn't have said that. Why would you have judged me? You barely know me.~
@78   = ~That is a very noble sentiment, <CHARNAME>, and admittedly unexpected from one of your race. I think I may have misjudged you.~
@79   = ~Why would you have judged me at all when we have barely even met?~
@80   = ~Unexpected? What made you think you knew my reasons?~
@81   = ~You think you "misjudged" me? I think you have some explaining to do, elf.~
@82   = ~A noble sentiment? You mean you yourself do not help others, regardless of circumstances?~
@83   = ~Well... yes.~
@84   = ~What is it supposed to change, then?~
@85   = ~Why would the fact that you're an Avariel change anything?~
@86   = ~Then enlighten me. Just what were you expecting me to do?~
@87   = ~I wasn't going to refuse to help just because your people think poorly of mine. I don't represent my entire race, you know.~
@88   = ~That is an... interesting perspective. You're not what I expected, <CHARNAME>.~
@89   = ~Then what did you expect?~
@90   = ~Why would you have "expected" anything of me?~
@91   = ~You can't expect anything of a person you hardly know, Darian. Why did you expect something of me?~
@92   = ~I know you probably mean well, but that is something I am not prepared to discuss with you.~
@93   = ~I... know. But I am not prepared to discuss it with you.~
@94   = ~<CHARNAME>... I think I'm ready to answer you. Answer you about why I acted like I did initially, and why I had so... judged you. It's not something I share lightly with an outsider, but you deserve an explanation.~
@95   = ~I'm glad you've finally come around, Darian. Please, talk.~
@96   = ~Indeed I do. Spit it out.~
@97   = ~And here I was just thinking you were never going to tell me. Go ahead.~
@98   = ~I already found an explanation. You needed time to build your story to persuade me you can be trusted. Too late. Your fabrications will get you nowhere.~
@99   = ~Thank you for hearing me out. Now... what do you know about my people, the Avariel, as you call us?~
@100  = ~Almost nothing. Even in the libraries of Candlekeep, there were never more than vague references to them. I did get the impression, though, that they were almost wiped out a long time ago.~
@101  = ~I remember an old tome in Candlekeep that talked about them. More than a thousand years ago, the Avariel boasted an advanced and populous civilization. But they came under attack by a massive onslaught of dragons, and were almost completely wiped out, and as it was, their civilization was utterly destroyed.~
@102  = ~I'm not surprised. The humans of Faerun have always chosen to forget about that period of history. About two thousand years ago, which was less than half a dozen generations for us, the Avariel ruled one of Faerun's great empires, an empire that stretched from the edge of the desert to the Spine of the World. We were a proud people.~
@103  = ~But how is it possible for such an empire to fall so quickly and so completely that all evidence of it has disappeared?~
@104  = ~But that civilization is gone. What happened to it?~
@105  = ~I'm amazed humans would keep such records... that's correct, in the essentials. But there's more to it than that. About two thousand years ago, which was less than half a dozen generations for us, the Avariel ruled one of Faerun's great empires, an empire that stretched from the edge of the desert to the Spine of the World. We were a proud people.~
@106  = ~It hasn't. Many ruins that lie scattered throughout the mountains of Faerun are, or were originally, ancient Avariel ruins. But those are among the only surviving relics of that period of history, aside from the surviving Avariel, of course.~
@107  = ~But what happened to the ancient Avariel?~
@108  = ~In a word: humans. They had always been present in Faerun-possibly for longer than the Avariel. But they were relatively primitive, and hadn't even learned to use iron yet. Until that abruptly and irrevocably changed. None of the survivors knew exactly what happened, and we were never able to find any official record, but there was suddenly a massive human uprising. It spread fast, and the ancient Avariel were forced to action.~
@109  = ~How did an uprising of primitive humans destroy such a powerful empire?~
@110  = ~As fascinating as this history lesson is, Darian, I would really appreciate it if you got to the point.~
@111  = ~Sorry-I'm not the best at this kind of thing. But I am getting there, and the history is important to what I'm trying to tell you.~
@112  = ~Then please continue.~
@113  = ~I knew I'd never get a straight answer out of you...~
@114  = ~*Yawn*... better make it fast...~
@115  = ~The humans were cruelly outmatched. They were a loosely organized band of primitives wielding bronze weapons against a powerful civilization that also wielded formidable magical abilities. The humans were slaughtered. But apparently, they had powers of their own, for the empire was then beset by a massive draconic assault, an attack they could not defend against. Ten years later, fewer than one in ten Avariel still lived, and their empire was erased from history. Those surviving Avariel regrouped high in the mountains, and began to slowly build anew.~
@116  = ~So... all that remains of the Avariel today are the descendants of those who survived the fall of their civilization?~
@117  = ~Is that what's behind it? You hate humans because of something that happened two thousand years ago?~
@118  = ~That's all very interesting, Darian, but what's it got to do with me?~
@119  = ~But... I'm elven. What does all this have to do with me?~
@120  = ~When the ancient Avariel sought assistance from other elven races, they were spurned. Moon elves accepted the humans, the wood elves retreated to the depths of the forests, and the gold elves fled Faerun.~
@121  = ~So... all that remains of the Avariel today are the descendants of what happened two thousand years ago?~
@122  = ~Is that it? You hate elves because of something that happened two thousand years ago?~
@123  = ~Yes. A small fraction of the ancient empire's population, hiding within a few scattered, rebuilt fortress-cities, are all that remains.~
@124  = ~Is that the answer I was looking for? You hate humans for the destruction of your people?~
@125  = ~I'm deeply sorry for what happened to your people, but what does ancient history have to do with me?~
@126  = ~Is that it? You hate elves for refusing to help your people during the fall of your civilization?~
@127  = ~But what's all this have to do with me?~
@128  = ~Hate? No, we do not hate humans for what they did so long ago. Actually, "fear" would be a better word. It is a fear that has driven us, that has guided us ever since. It is something that lives in all who still call themselves the Avariel.~
@129  = ~And... all that's left of your people are descendants of the survivors?~
@130  = ~That's very interesting, but what's it have to do with me?~
@131  = ~Everything. You are human, <CHARNAME>, just as I am Avariel. Ever since the fall, we have feared humans for what they can do. I was expecting you to attempt to kill me at any time since we first spoke in that run-down tavern. I was expecting to have to fight, and if necessary, kill you. But you are different. At every turn, you've defied my expectations, and worried me even more, because I did not, could not, know what you were planning. I don't know what you are, <CHARNAME>... but I don't think you're my enemy.~
@132  = ~I'm not your enemy, Darian, but I can be your friend.~
@133  = ~I'm not sure if I understand you, Darian, but I'm willing to be your friend.~
@134  = ~Sorry, Darian, but I just don't think I can believe you.~
@135  = ~Hate? No, we do not hate the other elves for their action, or rather, their inaction so long ago. But it did teach us one thing: if we were to survive, it would have to be on our own terms, independent of any other races, since not even our distant cousins could be trusted.~
@136  = ~Everything. You are elven, <CHARNAME>, just as I am Avariel. Ever since we first spoke in that run down tavern in Athkatla, I was expecting you to flee, to betray us at the worst moment. I was expecting you to be concerned wholly with your own survival. But you are different. You defied those expectations at every turn, which only worried me more, since I did not, could not, predict your actions. I don't know what you are, <CHARNAME>, but I don't think you're my enemy.~
@137  = ~I'm not. And I can be your friend.~
@138  = ~I still don't understand you, but I'm willing to befriend you.~
@139  = ~Your words ring false. I don't believe you.~
@140  = ~I understand your skepticism, but I don't know what else to say, beyond that you wanted to know my reasons, and I told you.~
@141  = ~Well, I don't know why, but I think I'm willing to be your friend.~
@142  = ~And I still don't believe you.~
@143  = ~Then I have nothing more to say to you.~
@144  = ~Friend? You're offering me your friendship? But you're a <PRO_RACE>... I don't understand.~
@145  = ~Not everything is so complicated as you imagine, Darian. I simply want to be your friend.~
@146  = ~Do you really need to understand? The concept of befriending a non-Avariel is not as complex as you think.~
@147  = ~The delicious irony of that comment aside, I really do want to be your friend.~
@148  = ~But you are a <PRO_RACE>. You've given me some things to think about, but don't think for a moment my guard is down.~
@149  = ~<CHARNAME>, is this a good time to talk to you again?~
@150  = ~Sure thing.~
@151  = ~What's wrong~
@152  = ~Is something troubling you?~
@153  = ~If you want to talk, I'm listening.~
@154  = ~Gladly.~
@155  = ~Not really. Can this wait?~
@156  = ~If you insist.~
@157  = ~You're an excellent fighter, easily the equal of any but the greatest warriors of Myrrhavin. What made you pursue the warrior's path?~
@158  = ~Fighting has always come naturally to me. Many of the people in Candlekeep thought it very unusual that a young girl would take such an active interest in weapons and warfare, but it was simply what I enjoyed and did best at.~
@159  = ~I'm a pretty straightforward person. I don't like sneaking around or relying on fancy tricks or spells - I simply like to go for my goal.~
@160  = ~I enjoy the thrill of the fight. Others can talk about the joys of outwitting another, or of destroying someone with a spell, but for me, there is no greater pleasure than matching my strength and skill against that of another in combat.~
@161  = ~I should have guessed as much - I've managed to learn a thing or two from watching you fight.~
@162  = ~I take it that means you've stopped holding yourself apart from others?~
@163  = ~I'm glad you're willing to admit you can learn from others, Darian.~
@164  = ~Are you sure that's all you've been watching me do?~
@165  = ~Nice to know I have a friendly neighborhood Avariel stalker.~
@166  = ~You hold yourself to unusually high standards of honor and virtue, <CHARNAME>-much higher than most. Why do you follow such standards?~
@167  = ~Because the more people hold themselves to honor and virtue, the better the Realms as a whole become.~
@168  = ~I seek to be a force of hope to the righteous, and of fear to the wicked.~
@169  = ~It is my belief that wherever I go in life, the world should be a better place for my passing.~
@170  = ~That is truly noble. I've learned from your earnest, forthright dedication to good.~
@171  = ~Do you no longer hold me unworthy of respect, then?~
@172  = ~Did you learn how to learn from others?~
@173  = ~I'm glad to see you change, Darian.~
@174  = ~You are more at home in the wild than the city, and respect and live alongside nature, <CHARNAME>. What made you seek to wander the wilderness?~
@175  = ~Cities always make me feel claustrophobic, to be honest. I prefer the unbound, untamed wilderness where I have plenty of elbow room.~
@176  = ~I yearn to explore, to eke out my destiny in the wilderness beyond what we know, what most people are comfortable in.~
@177  = ~I don't know, really, But the wild and the unknown call to me, and it is a call I cannot turn away from.~
@178  = ~That's an interesting perspective, <CHARNAME>, and one I think I've learned from.~
@179  = ~You'd be surprised what you can learn from, Darian... and whom.~
@180  = ~I'm happy for you, that you admit you can learn from others.~
@181  = ~We all heed our callings in life, Darian, and I think I know one calling you're a little slow to heed.~
@182  = ~You have a rather... unique array of skills, <CHARNAME>, and are very light on your feet. Where did you acquire your fascination with stealth and legerdemain?~
@183  = ~Oh, here and there, from no one who would willingly admit it.~
@184  = ~I've always been sneaky - I got into lots of trouble growing up, when various books and inkbottles all over Candlekeep displayed an unusual tendency to vanish and reappear elsewhere.~
@185  = ~Candlekeep was always a rather dull place. I did my best to change that. (Grin)~
@186  = ~I can't say I entirely approve, but I have learned a few things from your more... unorthodox approaches to situations.~
@187  = ~So you've finally gotten off your high horse and down in the mud with us, eh?~
@188  = ~Heh. Good to see you're capable of learning even from me.~
@189  = ~Why do I get the feeling I'm not the only one with a fascination with stealth? (Smirk)~
@190  = ~Stick with me, and I'll show you just how fun "unorthodox" can be.~
@191  = ~You have a most poetic soul, <CHARNAME> and great affinity for music. Where did you learn such skill?~
@192  = ~From my own heart, of course!~
@193  = ~No one taught me. My music springs from within.~
@194  = ~Music is a gift that can't be taught, Darian. It's a natural talent that fills you and lightens the world.~
@195  = ~A month ago, I'd have dismissed that as errant nonsense. But I've spent enough time around you that now, I'm not so sure.~
@196  = ~You see, you can indeed learn from others.~
@197  = ~Maybe it just took the right ballad to make you realize you can learn from others.~
@198  = ~Why, you almost say that as though you enjoy spending time around me!~
@199  = ~It really is rather sweet that you enjoy listening to my music so much.~
@200  = ~You display great dedication and piety to your god, <CHARNAME>. While such faith is the norm for an Avariel, what led you to take such a spiritual path?~
@201  = ~My god called, and I answered.~
@202  = ~I find peace in the teachings of my god, a peace hard to find otherwise.~
@203  = ~I once wondered if the Realms were really all there was to existence, if there was nothing more. I found I was wrong.~
@204  = ~The depth of your devotion is truly remarkable - I've learned that as devoted to Aerdrie Faeyna as I am, there are depths greater still.~
@205  = ~Glad to hear you're willing to learn now.~
@206  = ~The gods may be the source of all wisdom, but their servants can pass on some of that wisdom to others.~
@207  = ~If you wish, I can show you what faith means in my personal life.~
@208  = ~You are driven to uphold the balance of powers, of the forces in the world, all in the name of nature. May I ask why?~
@209  = ~Your concepts of good and evil, law and chaos, are limited - they are all powerful, but are themselves but aspects of the greater balance. I answer a higher calling, that of the balance and of nature itself.~
@210  = ~A storm rages within myself, between the natural and the unnatural, the mortal and the divine. In serving nature, I seek to calm the storm, and bring balance to myself.~
@211  = ~Society, civilization, gods - they are all but passing things, ephemeral and meaningless. Nature is all that was and will be.~
@212  = ~That is a most interesting way to think - you've opened my eyes to a few things, that's for certain.~
@213  = ~Ah, so you are beginning to understand the balance, learning from all sources, even those you do not trust.~
@214  = ~We all exist at nature's sufferance, Darian. Learning from her servants is but the first step towards wisdom.~
@215  = ~Your life must exist in balance - that which is unbalanced cannot stand.~
@216  = ~We are all drawn to the balance, and I think the draw you heed is stronger than most.~
@217  = ~You display great command of the arcane, <CHARNAME> - far greater than any I have seen yet. Where did you learn such magical ability?~
@218  = ~My foster father taught me a great deal. He was a mage of great power, and I suppose I just followed in his footsteps.~
@219  = ~I've always had some degree of magical power, to the extent that the monks of Candlekeep were half-convinced I had extraplanar heritage.~
@220  = ~I don't know, to be honest. It just sort of comes to me, and I bend it to my will.~
@221  = ~I never really learned it, per se. For me, it is purely instinctive, a matter of my gut and my heart.~
@222  = ~I have no ability to use the arcane myself, but if I remain near you much longer, I'll learn more than I could have imagined about how magic works.~
@223  = ~Even if it's unwillingly, it's good to know you've decided you can learn from others.~
@224  = ~If you're willing to learn from others now, I'll be happy to teach you all I know.~
@225  = ~And to think I was just about to cast a charm spell to make you admit that.~
@226  = ~I do admit I can learn from you, <CHARNAME>, but don't think I've dropped my guard around you - I know you're up to something.~
@227  = ~Awww. You're so cute when you're embarassed.~
@228  = ~Now, now. It's perfectly okay to admit you have feelings.~
@229  = ~Then why are you blushing?~
@230  = ~Your voice says one thing, but your body says another.~
@231  = ~You really are just a big winged teddy bear, aren't you?~
@232  = ~If you're not comfortable with your own feelings, that's okay - I'm here to help.~
@233  = ~(Darian abruptly turns around and walks away from you)~
@234  = ~I see. But don't think I'm letting my guard down just because I've admitted I can learn from you. You're all the more dangerous now.~
@235  = ~<CHARNAME>, I've come to a conclusion I think you should know about.~
@236  = ~For <CHARNAME>'s sake, Darian, stay away from her.~
@237  = ~This is between <CHARNAME> and I, Anomen. For her sake, stay out of this.~
@238  = ~I can see the way you look at her, Darian, even if you hide it from everyone else.~
@239  = ~If I thought you had some idea what you were talking about, I might have an intelligent response.~
@240  = ~You know full well what I speak of.~
@241  = ~I cannot know about that which does not exist. However, <CHARNAME>, there is something I know about that I feel I should inform you of.~
@242  = ~What conclusion would this be?~
@243  = ~Nothing that affects you~
@244  = ~If it affects <CHARNAME>, it affects me. You know this.~
@245  = ~I do. But my words are for <CHARNAME> alone. If you wish to speak with her afterwards, she will tell you whatever she wishes.~
@246  = ~As you wish, Darian.~
@247  = ~Thank you. <CHARNAME>, there is something you should know about.~
@248  = ~Oh? What about?~
@249  = ~I'm always happy to talk.~
@250  = ~What do you want?~
@251  = ~Sorry, but you can take that pompous tone elsewhere.~
@252  = ~If that is your wish, I will respect it.~
@253  = ~Oh, nevermind. Let's hear it.~
@254  = ~Yes, I think things have gone far enough.~
@255  = ~I haven't been at my best the last few times we've talked, <CHARNAME>. Every time I think I can predict you, you prove me wrong. You are like no one and no thing I have ever encountered.~
@256  = ~Ironically, Darian, you in turn are like nothing I've ever encountered, either.~
@257  = ~Heh. I may just do a better job of hiding it, but you actually tend to put me off guard as well.~
@258  = ~Darian, everyone has their quirks that make them hard to understand. You have plenty of your own.~
@259  = ~I suppose there's an ironic symmetry there. Hmmm... once all this is done and over with, I think I'll need to present my report to the rest of the Talons personally -  you and your kind are far more complicated than we imagine.~
@260  = ~Come again? You've been keeping a report on me?~
@261  = ~So you've been monitoring me and keeping a record of my behavior all this time?~
@262  = ~If I knew you'd be taking your time in this party to spy on me and carefully write it all down for evaluation, I'd never have accepted your offer to help.~
@263  = ~Correct. Based on your actions, I don't think you have harmful intentions towards myself or Myrrhavin, but things I cannot understand tend to be very dangerous, and I cannot understand you.~
@264  = ~Darian, I'm not a danger. You have to trust me.~
@265  = ~You'll never understand anyone if you refuse to acknowledge the concept of trusting someone, Darian.~
@266  = ~Then why are you still here? You've made it perfectly clear that you don't trust me and consider me a danger.~
@267  = ~You should have known that I monitor all potential threats, <CHARNAME>. Even though I'm reasonably certain you don't intend harm to myself or Myrrhavin, from the way you've acted, I don't understand you, and that makes you all the more dangerous.~
@268  = ~Darian, it's impossible to ever truly understand someone. I'm not a threat to you.~
@269  = ~The unknown isn't always dangerous, Darian. If you would only trust me, you'd know that by now.~
@270  = ~If I'm so dangerous, then why are you still here?~
@271  = ~Trust you? Trust a woman whose goals are incomprehensible to me, and who attracts more trouble than an orcish horde marching on the Dales?~
@272  = ~Yes, Darian, trust me. Do you really think I'm such a danger to you?~
@273  = ~By the gods, Darian, I'm trying to be your friend!~
@274  = ~Then why in the hells are you still here?!~
@275  = ~Friend? We have had this conversation before, <CHARNAME>. I am willing to work with you, fight alongside you if need be, but that is the extent of our relationship.~
@276  = ~Am I really so dangerous in your mind that you cannot even tolerate the idea of being friends with a non-Avariel?~
@277  = ~Sometimes I wonder why you're still here, from the way you act.~
@278  = ~You may do an excellent job of lying to yourself, but I know you're just trying to avoid the real issue here.~
@279  = ~Because I told you I would help rescue your friend, even when it means helping such an infuriatingly incomprehensible woman as you.~
@280  = ~Yes, you are. But even so, I told you I would help rescue your friend. And I follow my duty, even when it means helping a woman as exasperating as you are.~
@281  = ~There is no "real issue" here! Oh, Aerdrie Faeyna, grant me patience enough to deal with this woman...~
@282  = ~What's wrong, <CHARNAME>?~
@283  = ~There you go again... asking me a question without providing the subtext that always seems to accompany your questions.~
@284  = ~What do you mean "what's wrong"? There are a great many things that are wrong.~
@285  = ~If this is another of your probing questions, I don't need to hear it.~
@286  = ~Then we are done talking.~
@287  = ~Since you already know I monitor your behavior, I see no need to hide the fact that there is clearly something that's bothering you a great deal, and if it endangers the party, I should probably know about it.~
@288  = ~And just what behavior have you seen that makes you think I'm hiding a problem?~
@289  = ~I'm hiding nothing, Darian - which is far more than you can say.~
@290  = ~Sleep comes slowly and uneasily for you, and even when it does, you are clearly gripped by nightmares, rolling around and muttering things.~
@291  = ~You've been watching me sleep?!~
@292  = ~You'd better have a damn good excuse for this, Darian...~
@293  = ~I've been tolerating your behavior thus far, but watching me sleep goes over the line.~
@294  = ~I will not apologize. I keep watch on everyone - especially you. And you are frequently gripped by what seem to be intense nightmares, far beyond the normal standard. Is there a problem I should be aware of?~
@295  = ~Yes, there is. Next time, just come out and say it.~
@296  = ~Aside from you having such a hard time admitting your concern about me is more than just professional?~
@297  = ~There is. If you care about me, stop hiding behind the pretense of duty and mission.~
@298  = ~Your sleeping behavior indicates otherwise. When I enter the reverie, I'm not completely oblivious to the world, and I know you spend most nights in the depths of nightmares, constantly muttering. Something is wrong, and you're trying to hide it.~
@299  = ~Well, I suppose it's no use denying it... you are rather perceptive when it comes to people, yourself excluded.~
@300  = ~Is it honestly so hard to admit you're concerned about me?~
@301  = ~Yes, something is wrong. You could have just asked, instead of skirting around the issue like you always do.~
@302  = ~Then what is wrong?~
@303  = ~That a man I've been traveling with has such a hard time admitting he's concerned about me.~
@304  = ~That you have no idea what your own heart says.~
@305  = ~That I've given you every chance in the book to open up, but you are still too proud to do so.~
@306  = ~I... I don't know what you're talking about, <CHARNAME>.~
@307  = ~Oh, yes you do. You're simply too scared of lowering your guard in front of me to admit it. You'd find you understand me better than you think, if only you'd listen to your own damn feelings.~
@308  = ~As much as you like to fool yourself, you can't fool me so easily. I know your behavior as well as you know mine, and you know perfectly well why I keep throwing you off guard.~
@309  = ~Of course you don't! And you never will.~
@310  = ~My feelings have nothing to do with this!~
@311  = ~My, my. You're awfully touchy.~
@312  = ~If they don't, then explain why every time we talk, you relax just enough around me to be scared.~
@313  = ~Fine by me! Go hide behind your precious duty and culture, like you always do!~
@314  = ~You! You... I am sorry. I simply don't know what else to say.~
@315  = ~I am sorry, too. This clearly isn't something you're ready to talk about.~
@316  = ~As much fun as it is to see you flat-footed, I apologize for pushing you over the edge like that.~
@317  = ~(Smirk) I do seem to have that effect on you. But... perhaps I was out of line as well. This isn't an easy thing for you.~
@318  = ~Because!... Because... I... I don't know.~
@319  = ~Perhaps you will, in time.~
@320  = ~When you do, I'm always here to talk to you.~
@321  = ~And that's the first step towards learning.~
@322  = ~(Pauses for a long moment) That is not something I am ready to discuss.~
@323  = ~Whenever you are, I'll be here.~
@324  = ~You don't always need to keep your guard up. Whether you like it or not, I *am* your friend.~
@325  = ~I have a... feeling... it will come in time.~
@326  = ~(Darian slowly turns away, his expression troubled)~
@327  = ~<CHARNAME>, there is something about you that concerns me.~
@328  = ~So you're finally admitting you're concerned about me? You're getting there, Darian.~
@329  = ~Oh, I can't wait to hear this...~
@330  = ~This is getting downright rich. You call me incomprehensible when prying information out of you is like pulling teeth...~
@331  = ~Your precious "concern" can burn in the Abyss, Darian! Gods, it's no wonder you're such a loner!~
@332  = ~Bold words from one such as you.~
@333  = ~I'm not concerned about you as a person, but when we talk to people, I keep hearing about how you stopped a war further north, on the Sword Coast. Is this true?~
@334  = ~Yes, Darian, I did stop a war. But it is much more complicated than it sounds.~
@335  = ~My deeds have probably been greatly exaggerated, and there's much more to the story than whatever you've heard, but I did stop a war, yes.~
@336  = ~Why do you care about what I may or may not have done up north?~
@337  = ~When we talk to people, I keep hearing about how you stopped a war on the Sword Coast. Is this true?~
@338  = ~It's a long story, but ultimately, yes.~
@339  = ~I don't know what you've heard, exactly, but I did indeed stop a war.~
@340  = ~Why do my past actions concern you?~
@341  = ~You are entitled to your feelings. Irregardless, when we talk to people, I constantly hear tales about how you stopped a war to the north. Is this true?~
@342  = ~The tales don't tell the half of it. Ultimately, though, I did stop a war.~
@343  = ~Why are you so interested in what I did prior to arriving in Amn?~
@344  = ~I'm still trying to understand you. I can evaluate your actions here, but I've heard some fairly tall tales of what happened on the Sword Coast.~
@345  = ~Why are you trying so hard to understand me? You certainly don't devote this much effort to understanding anyone else we've met?~
@346  = ~If you keep this up, I'll start to think you're trying to do more than just understand a threat.~
@347  = ~If it'll get you off my back, I did stop a war, yes.~
@348  = ~No one else is as infuriatingly difficult to understand as you are. Your actions speak well enough for you, but your motives make little sense.~
@349  = ~Sigh... talking to you is like smashing my head into a stone wall. The squishy sound is starting to bore me, so the answer is yes: I did stop a war on the Sword Coast.~
@350  = ~As much fun as talking to you can be, I think I'd better answer your original question before I embarass you again. The tales you've heard don't cover the half of it, but I did stop a war up north.~
@351  = ~Oh, by the light of Aerdrie Faeyna...~
@352  = ~(Smirk) I think I'd better answer your original question before you get too embarassed to talk. I did stop a war on the Sword Coast.~
@353  = ~So... how did you end up stopping a war?~
@354  = ~A man named Sarevok wanted to start a war between Baldur's Gate and Amn. One that would elevate him to godhood by virtue of the slaughter.~
@355  = ~That makes no sense... how could starting a war elevate him to godhood? Humans are a warlike race, and they certainly don't become gods frequently.~
@356  = ~Sarevok was no ordinary human. He was a the son of a god-a bastard child of Bhaal.~
@357  = ~Bhaal?~
@358  = ~The god of murder, killed during the Time of Troubles. But somehow, he had learned that he would be destroyed during the Godswar, and seeded countless mortal women with his progeny. Sarevok was one such child.~
@359  = ~That humans would even have a god of murder frightens me... the Menel'Quessir know little of the Time of Troubles - it largely passed us by, and it affected us little.~
@360  = ~All the human gods - maybe the elven ones, too, I don't know - were cast down into the world as mortal beings by Ao, save Helm. Some died, and some new gods arose - Bhaal fell, and Cyric took his portfolio. Sarevok learned of his heritage, and attempted to cause such a slaughter that he would be elevated to his father's former place.~
@361  = ~And so you decided to stop him. That you would willingly face a being born of divine blood, especially the blood of such a malevolent deity, is... beyond words.~
@362  = ~Darian, my situation... was not as simple as you think.~
@363  = ~There's much more to the story than that - it's much more complicated.~
@364  = ~That isn't the entire story. There are... complications... I didn't tell you.~
@365  = ~Such things never are. I need time to think about this.~
@366  = ~I would have been surprised if it was not. But for now, I have to think about this.~
@367  = ~They can wait. I have to think about what you've told me.~
@368  = ~<CHARNAME>, I wish to apologize for ending our last conversation so abruptly. I was thinking about what you said, and I have to ask you something.~
@369  = ~I have a feeling I know what you're about to ask...~
@370  = ~I suppose I couldn't expect you to stay blind forever.~
@371  = ~I knew this conversation was inevitable - let's get it over with.~
@372  = ~There are others, aren't there? Other children of Bhaal.~
@373  = ~Yes, but no one knows how many.~
@374  = ~The prophecies spoke of a great many, in fact.~
@375  = ~I believe so, yes.~
@376  = ~As alarming as that is... there's more to it than that, isn't there?~
@377  = ~Yes, Darian... I am one of the children.~
@378  = ~Sarevok is... was... my half-brother.~
@379  = ~I don't think I'm ready to talk about this, Darian.~
@380  = ~There is, but it does not concern you.~
@381  = ~It's none of your business.~
@382  = ~I can certainly understand that, but... there's something you aren't telling me. Something very important. I have my suspicion, and pray to Aerdrie Faeyna that I'm wrong, but would prefer not to have to ask you directly.~
@383  = ~You're too perceptive for your own good, Darian. Yes, I am one of the children.~
@384  = ~You really do make keeping something a secret a bit of a pain. Bhaal was indeed my father.~
@385  = ~And just what exactly do you suspect?~
@386  = ~You're really starting to become a winged pain in the arse...~
@387  = ~Then... are you yourself a child of Bhaal?~
@388  = ~Yes, I... yes, I am.~
@389  = ~Honestly, I think I'm going to smack you into a wall one of these days, but in this case, you're right.~
@390  = ~You are really starting to scare me... and you are also correct.~
@391  = ~Then... I don't understand. You're a bastard daughter of the human god of murder, but you yourself are not evil. This Sarevok was someone I would have gladly given my life to destroy, but you in turn are someone I am proud to fight alongside.~
@392  = ~I don't let my blood control me, Darian. I choose who I want to be, and I despise the evil that overcame Sarevok.~
@393  = ~I may have been born with the blood of Bhaal in my veins, but that is not who I am.~
@394  = ~I fight for justice, no matter what flows in my body.~
@395  = ~I control my blood - it does not control me.~
@396  = ~I can see the truth of your words in your every action, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps... perhaps the simple question of what one is born is not all there truly is to a person. Perhaps it is what one does with what they are born that decides a person's nature, and their fate. You've... you've given me a lot to think about.~
@397  = ~<CHARNAME>, if you don't mind, I'd like to speak with you about some of the things we talked about last time.~
@398  = ~Of course. I always have time for you.~
@399  = ~You know my burden, Darian. We will never speak of it again.~
@400  = ~As... as you wish.~
@401  = ~With the blood of Bhaal coursing through your veins... how do you maintain your sanity? I don't understand how you remain an honorable woman when you have every excuse to be an evil monster.~
@402  = ~It is a struggle. I always try to do what's right, but my blood rebels against every good choice, ever life I do not take.~
@403  = ~My blood holds no power over me. I am not evil, and I never will be, no matter who my so-called father was.~
@404  = ~Quite frankly, I don't know. It is a terrible battle I fight every waking moment, a battle to remain in control of myself, and a battle to not give in to my blood.~
@405  = ~My blood, and the evil in it, has taken too much from me. I refuse to give in to it.~
@406  = ~That must be a struggle indeed. Merely overcoming your more base human instincts must be difficult enough.~
@407  = ~But it is a struggle I refuse to give up. The Realms need me.~
@408  = ~Difficult, yes, but it is a fight I cannot afford to lose.~
@409  = ~I fight gladly. I will not allow my blood to be loosed upon the Realms.~
@410  = ~Just as you struggle against your instincts. We all fight against ourselves, Darian.~
@411  = ~Then I will pray to Aerdrie Faeyna that she grant you the strength to win your terrible, personal battle.~
@412  = ~Yes indeed, from what I've seen of you. Pray to whatever god you worship for strength, <CHARNAME>-it seems you will need it.~
@413  = ~Then you have a will of meteoric steel. To be able to so easily push aside your blood, your instincts...~
@414  = ~I will not let my blood take control of me, and that's the end of it.~
@415  = ~We are what we choose to be, not what our blood would have us be.~
@416  = ~I do not wish to become what my blood demands, therefore I am not.~
@417  = ~Such a bloodcurse must take a heavy toll, that is certain. I am glad you have not given in.~
@418  = ~My blood has cost me much. It will not have me.~
@419  = ~And I am glad as well. For the sake of everyone around me, I cannot give in.~
@420  = ~To give in is unthinkable. It has cost me too much.~
@421  = ~A most intriguing insight. Once again, you've given me much to think about.~
@422  = ~Who is this "Imoen" you're trying to rescue? She must be very important you to to warrant such an effort to save.~
@423  = ~Imoen's a very dear friend of mine, from Candlekeep.~
@424  = ~I've known Imoen forever - she's practically my little sister.~
@425  = ~She's a bit of a brat, but she's an old friend nevertheless.~
@426  = ~Ah, that explains much. But I am very surprised a <PRO_RACE> would go to such lengths to rescue one of their own.~
@427  = ~Darian, my kind are not like you think they are. Judge others based on their actions, not thousand-year-old cultural prejudices.~
@428  = ~Are you still so blinded by your cultural legacy that refuse to see that my kind are not what they think they are?~
@429  = ~And here we go again... I'll put this in simple terms. My. Race. Is. Not. Evil.~
@430  = ~Oh, I am sick and tired of that holier-than-thou complex of yours, Darian! Even now, you refuse to accept that my race is capable of decency!~
@431  = ~Hmph. You merely prove my point.~
@432  = ~It is true that you have taught me that you yourself are not an evil person - you are an honorable woman I am proud to fight alongside, and you have given me great hope for your race. But... I suppose some instincts die hard, if they do so at all.~
@433  = ~Were your instincts given physical form, I'd hand you a sword to slay them with. What are you going to do?~
@434  = ~A fight I know all too well. Are you going to give in to your instincts, or change?~
@435  = ~Don't I know how that one goes... are you going to win this fight, or lose?~
@436  = ~I... was wrong about you, and your race. I cannot say I fully trust your kind, but I see now that you are no better and no worse than the Avariel-individuals may be evil, but the race as a whole is not. You're going to extraordinary lengths to rescue an old friend from a most dangerous enemy, and that speaks extremely well of you. I... am sorry, about all the things I said to you, all the things I implied.~
@437  = ~I accept your apology. Come, let's get moving before the others wonder what we're up to.~
@438  = ~You took what seemed the best course of action at the time - you have nothing to be sorry for. We'd better get moving.~
@439  = ~Then let's get going.~
@440  = ~(As the party settles in for the night, you notice Darian standing alone at the edge of camp. He is staring into the darkness, a haunted look on his face.)~
@441  = ~Darian?~
@442  = ~(Say nothing)~
@443  = ~(Even when you drift off to sleep, Darian remains at his station, staring into the night)~
@444  = ~What the?! Oh, it's just you, <CHARNAME>. My apologies - you startled me.~
@445  = ~What were you doing?~
@446  = ~You don't look so good. What's going on?~
@447  = ~Something's bothering you, Darian. Is it something I can help you with?~
@448  = ~(Darian doesn't respond, and turns back to the dark)~
@449  = ~Darian, something's wrong. Talk to me.~
@450  = ~Fine! Talking to you is a waste of time anyhow.~
@451  = ~Have you... have you ever done anything in your life you weren't very proud of? I suspect you might have, given your darkly divine blood, even as you have struggled against it.~
@452  = ~Yes... yes, I have.~
@453  = ~No, but I've come very close.~
@454  = ~No. I've always kept myself firmly disciplined by my sense of right and wrong.~
@455  = ~Then maybe you will understand, even though you are a <PRO_RACE>. Please promise that you won't hold what I'm about to tell you against me.~
@456  = ~Of course I won't. Everyone's been through some dark times in their life, some more than others.~
@457  = ~We all have our regrets, Darian. I won't hold yours against you.~
@458  = ~I make no promises.~
@459  = ~Then you are very fortunate. But I suppose you might understand. Please promise that you won't hold what I'm about to tell you against me.~
@460  = ~I promise. If you need to talk about something, go ahead.~
@461  = ~Yes, I have been fortunate. But if you need to get something off your chest, I won't hold it against you.~
@462  = ~I can't promise you that, Darian.~
@463  = ~Then I envy you. And I don't imagine you would understand.~
@464  = ~I think I would surprise you, if you're willing to talk about it.~
@465  = ~If you need to talk, Darian, I will listen.~
@466  = ~I don't think I would. Keep your own counsel.~
@467  = ~Then I was a fool to think you might have understood what I was about to tell you, and a fool for almost thinking I could trust you.~
@468  = ~You may not recall, but when I told you about the history of my people, I told you the Avariel feared your kind, humans. But I don't know if you really understand just how far it goes. Humans that travel near an Avariel city are closely, and secretly, watched. And, depending on the situation, we either lure them away from the city or, if we think the human may have learned there is something not quite right about the area, we take... measures.~
@469  = ~What kind of measures?~
@470  = ~This sounds very ominous... what do you do, exactly?~
@471  = ~What happens?~
@472  = ~You may not recall, but when I told you about the history of my people, I told you the Avariel feared humans - we fear them more than any other race on Faerun. But I don't know if you really understand just how far it goes. Humans that travel near an Avariel city are closely, and secretly, watched. And, depending on the situation, we either lure them away from the city or, if we think the human may have learned there is something not quite right about the area, we take... measures.~
@473  = ~We... kill them. Without warning, without mercy. We are determined to keep our presence secret... at any cost. Typically, we set careful traps, or have marksmen kill them from afar with poisoned bolts. They never know that they were... murdered... let alone why. We then carefully mutilate the dead, and arrange a scene to reflect what we want the search parties to see. A bandit attack gone awry, perhaps, or an angry beast.~
@474  = ~But you're not so bothered by that, are you? There's something else to this, isn't there?~
@475  = ~That's horrible... but it isn't what's on your mind is it? There's more to the story than that.~
@476  = ~As wrong as that is, there's something you're not telling me.~
@477  = ~... Yes. About five years ago, I was on patrol when I spotted a family of human refugees heading into the mountains. They were fleeing some battle that had destroyed their home, I think - I never really knew. But they were, unknowingly, heading straight for Myrrhavin. All our attempts to divert them had failed. It was my task, it was my duty... to kill them.~
@478  = ~And... did you?~
@479  = ~Yes. I had my orders, and they would have stumbled upon evidence of Myrrhavin in another few days. I was sworn to defend my people at all costs, and so I followed my orders. I... prepared a trap, one that would trigger a rock slide as they moved through a ravine. It worked perfectly. But as I flew to the slide to make sure there were no survivors, I found that there was one. (His voice breaks)~
@480  = ~(Place a hand on his shoulder) Darian, I'm not going to blame you for what you did. What happened?~
@481  = ~I can't believe you did such a thing, but please... tell me what happened.~
@482  = ~It was a young human girl. She had been badly injured in the slide - half of her face was crushed, and there was blood everywhere. But somehow, she was still conscious. And as I hovered over the scene, I saw in her eyes a look of such absolute horror and fear that I wanted to turn away in disgust. Disgust of me, of what I did. I told myself that I did what I had to do - did what was necessary to protect my people. But the same actions that made me a valiant defender of Myrrhavin... also made me a monster in the eyes of a little girl crushed in a rock slide, who did not, could not have known why.~
@483  = ~Darian, you did what you thought you had to do to defend your people. There is nothing wrong with that.~
@484  = ~Then why did you stay amongst the Talons, if you were so disgusted?~
@485  = ~You may be many things, but you aren't a monster.~
@486  = ~You're perfectly correct: you are a monster! They were innocent people!~
@487  = ~(Tears form in his eyes, and he suddenly turns around and walks away into the gloom).~
@488  = ~But there is! Defending my people isn't supposed to mean murdering innocent men, women, and children!~
@489  = ~If you were so disgusted, why did you stay with the Talons?~
@490  = ~I know you, Darian, and you aren't a monster.~
@491  = ~Darian, you did do a terrible thing. But you can't keep punishing yourself for it.~
@492  = ~Because... because I was able to convince myself I had done the right thing.~
@493  = ~You were doing your duty. There's nothing wrong with that.~
@494  = ~You are not a monster, Darian. Your very remorse shows otherwise.~
@495  = ~And now, you're not so sure. You can't keep punishing yourself for what you did.~
@496  = ~But how do you define a monster, <CHARNAME>? I murdered five innocent people just to protect the existence of a people they could not have known were there!~
@497  = ~Darian, you did what you thought you had to to. There is nothing wrong with that.~
@498  = ~If you were so disgusted with your actions, why did you stay amongst the Talons?~
@499  = ~Darian, I know you. You can't keep punishing yourself like this.~
@500  = ~But I vowed to protect my people! And...~
@501  = ~Darian, you paid your price, your punishment carried out. Are you going to learn from your experience, or not?~
@502  = ~Are you still so blinded by your outlook that you don't even see what fate was trying to teach you?~
@503  = ~We have all done bad things, Darian. But the important part is: do we learn from them?~
@504  = ~I think I have learned, in my own way. I simply didn't want to admit it. But you... you've taught me a great deal as well, and one of the things you've taught me is to... admit the things I have a hard time with. I... I think I have been wrong for a long time, <CHARNAME>. Your people, your kind, are not evil. There may be some who are, but really, I'm no better, and no worse.~
@505  = ~Don't be so quick to thank me. If anything, I think you'll find your life is going to be more complicated from here on out, knowing that.~
@506  = ~Darian, I think you knew that all along. It just took a little prying to get you to realize that you knew it.~
@507  = ~Learning that was as much your deed as mine. But it is good to see the change.~
@508  = ~(Turns once again to the gloom, but for once, there is a peaceful expression on his face)~
@509  = ~<CHARNAME>... some time ago, you tried to befriend me. I told you I wasn't ready for that.~
@510  = ~Yes, what of it?~
@511  = ~Are you saying you're ready now?~
@512  = ~I take it something's changed?~
@513  = ~You've taught me a great deal, <CHARNAME>. Some things, I'm not sure are lessons for the better, but they are lessons nevertheless. I have come to consider you a... friend.~
@514  = ~That's good to hear.~
@515  = ~Took you long enough to admit it.~
@516  = ~I consider you a friend as well.~
@517  = ~Oh, I think you want to be more than just my friend...~
@518  = ~Just so long as you know you are just a friend, nothing more.~
@519  = ~Then let's continue with your objective, my friend.~
@520  = ~Sigh... you and your race are incomprehensible, even if I do consider you a friend.~
@521  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you have any family, other than Imoen?~
@522  = ~Gorion - the elderly mage I always looked up to as my father.~
@523  = ~My biological father doesn't bear thinking about, but my foster father was Gorion, an elderly wizard.~
@524  = ~Gorion is the only other person I acknowledge as family - he was my foster father.~
@525  = ~That's none of your business.~
@526  = ~Ah, it is good you had a father you could look up to. What was he like?~
@527  = ~He was a classic absent-minded old wizard, but I never doubted his love for me.~
@528  = ~He was strict, but raised me with love.~
@529  = ~He gave me a love of freedom to explore and do what I wanted, but he always looked over my shoulder, making sure I didn't hurt myself.~
@530  = ~He was a man of few words, but his love for me was plain to see.~
@531  = ~Heh. I can't say I know what that was like - my father was always rather strict about things. A good man, and a good father, but he had a sharp mind.~
@532  = ~I'd like to hear more about your father, if you don't mind.~
@533  = ~Was there anyone else in your family you were close to?~
@534  = ~Well, we are our fathers' children, I suppose.~
@535  = ~Ah, that I can understand. My own father was much the same way.~
@536  = ~I'd like to hear more about him, if you would.~
@537  = ~Were you close to anyone else in your family.~
@538  = ~We are our fathers' children, after all.~
@539  = ~Understandable - elves know you learn best by doing, even if my father was rather strict about it.~
@540  = ~Could you tell me more about your father?~
@541  = ~Did you have a close relationship with anyone else in your family?~
@542  = ~Even elves are their fathers' children it appears.~
@543  = ~It is good that he loved you, no matter what he did or did not say. My father acted much the same way.~
@544  = ~So you were close to your father?~
@545  = ~Were you close to anyone else in your family?~
@546  = ~Well, we are our fathers' children.~
@547  = ~My father is named Aalanris, and he was a scout for many decades - one of the best marksmen in Myrrhavin. He retired to raise the family, though. He is a proud and disciplined man, and made sure to instill those virtues in me. I always looked up to him as the person I wanted to become, and he was very proud of me when I was offered the chance to become a Talon.~
@548  = ~Were you close to anyone else?~
@549  = ~Thank you for sharing that with me.~
@550  = ~Yes, my little sister, Lindor. The name means "songbird" in elven, and it fits her pefectly. She's mischievous, but always manages to charm her way out of all the trouble she gets into. I always looked after her, though, and she developed a gift for magic. She had just started training under one of the Val'Istari - the Archmages - when I departed Myrrhavin on my assignment.~
@551  = ~Would you mind telling me more about your father?~
@552  = ~Thank you very much for sharing that.~
@553  = ~It would seem so.~
@554  = ~It was my pleasure.~
@555  = ~Go ahead.~
@556  = ~This really isn't the best time.~
@557  = ~I will respect your wish.~
@558  = ~When we talked about our respective families before, I noticed you never mentioned your mother. Is there any reason why?~
@559  = ~I was raised by Gorion alone - he very rarely mentioned my mother. I think it brought to him very painful memories.~
@560  = ~I never knew my mother - Gorion said little about her, and gave what I now know to be evasive answers when I asked.~
@561  = ~My mother is none of your business.~
@562  = ~That must have been hard. I don't envy you, having so little in the way of family.~
@563  = ~Why does my family concern you so much?~
@564  = ~What's it matter to you?~
@565  = ~Why do you keep asking about my family?~
@566  = ~This just another entry in your report, I presume?~
@567  = ~Hmmm... there's probably a complication to the story, then, much like there seems to be with all of your family.~
@568  = ~Why does my family matter to you?~
@569  = ~There any reason I should keep telling you about my family?~
@570  = ~If this is just going to be another page in that report of yours, I don't think I'll talk to you anymore.~
@571  = ~I'm still trying to understand you, even though a rational being would have given up hope of doing so long ago. Home and family are very important to the Menel'Quessir, as is the duty to keep them safe. I see you: a woman without a home, and who has lost what little family she has, and I'm amazed you're as strong as you are.~
@572  = ~Could you tell me more about your family?~
@573  = ~Turnabout's fair play, then. What about your family?~
@574  = ~Would you mind telling me more about your family?~
@575  = ~My family does not concern you.~
@576  = ~Actually, I stopped writing in my report some time ago. I'm concerned about you - home and family are very important to the Avariel, and you've lost both.~
@577  = ~I would like to hear more about your family.~
@578  = ~Is there anything more you can tell me about your family?~
@579  = ~I already told you about my father and my sister. But my family name is Antharrna - "Vigilant Storm" in your tongue. We're a long line of warriors - every member of the family has served in the military as far back as we know. My mother was a battle-mage, herself - we think my sister's magical ability comes from her. I was glad to carry on the family legacy and become a Talon.~
@580  = ~Your family sounds very nice. I envy you.~
@581  = ~They sound like a wonderful family. Perhaps we'll be able to visit them someday.~
@582  = ~Oh, to hells with your family! You know full well what happened to mine - I have no need to hear about yours!~
@583  = ~I... am sorry for offending you.~
@584  = ~Perhaps, once all this is over, you'll be able to raise a family of your own. But for now, I suppose we had best return to our travels.~
@585  = ~Ah... it would be highly improper of me to bring a <PRO_RACE> to Myrrhavin, and you wouldn't find my people very hospitable, I'm afraid. But come, let's get back to our travels.~
@586  = ~Hopefully, what family you do have will be secure soon.~
@587  = ~<CHARNAME>, I think you should know something... I've decided to stop keeping my report on you.~
@588  = ~Might I ask why?~
@589  = ~Do you still not trust me?~
@590  = ~I'm sorry, but I really don't need to hear this.~
@591  = ~I feel that keeping a report on you was improper, despite my orders. You are a friend, and should be treated as such.~
@592  = ~Would you have treated an Avariel any differently?~
@593  = ~Sounds like you aren't too sure what "friend" means.~
@594  = ~You don't even know what a friend is, and I don't think there's a need any longer for you to consider me as such.~
@595  = ~I do trust you. That is why I have decided to no longer keep a report.~
@596  = ~Well, thank you for your trust.~
@597  = ~You don't even know what trust is, Darian.~
@598  = ~For a long time, I would have. But you are an... equal, <CHARNAME>.~
@599  = ~You make that sound like a painful admission.~
@600  = ~Coming from you, that's high praise indeed.~
@601  = ~I don't think that's all you see me as...~
@602  = ~Oh, please. You've always considered yourself my superior, and I don't think that's changed.~
@603  = ~I should have trusted my instincts - to think I was ready to believe I could deal with a <PRO_RACE> as I could a Menel'Quessiri. I am a fool.~
@604  = ~You've challenged many of my most basic principles, <CHARNAME>. I don't know a man for whom that would not be painful.~
@605  = ~It was not my intention to be haughty or give the impression I considered you inferior. Far from it. And I apologize if I gave the wrong impression.~
@606  = ~I suppose you're attempting to display what your kind calls a silver tongue? Yours is badly tarnished.~
@607  = ~Yes, you and I both know it extends a bit beyond that.~
@608  = ~Well, at least I know you're upholding your end of our relationship.~
@609  = ~Why do you continue to display such persistent... interest... in me?~
@610  = ~I like the strong, silent type.~
@611  = ~I have an overactive libido. You'll do.~
@612  = ~Because I really find you rather handsome, in an exotic way.~
@613  = ~You're a very composed, dignified man. That makes you incredibly fun to play with.~
@614  = ~You're and elf and you've got wings. Do I need any other reasons?~
@615  = ~You know perfectly well why, and I'd wager you're just as interested, even if you are better at hiding it.~
@616  = ~You're the only decent-looking man in the party. Who else am I going to hit on?~
@617  = ~You're really quite adorable when I embarass you.~
@618  = ~Oh, for the love of Aerdrie Faeyna...~
@619  = ~I do now. And that is why I'm no longer keeping a report on you.~
@620  = ~Thank you for your trust.~
@621  = ~You have a lot to learn about what friendship is. And you won't learn it from me.~
@622  = ~Don't thank me. You earned my trust, and it was wrong of me to not grant it.~
@623  = ~<CHARNAME>, have you given any thought to what you will do, where you will go, after you resolve this... mess you've found yourself in?~
@624  = ~I intend to keep adventuring. I've come to enjoy the danger and the excitement of the road.~
@625  = ~I was hoping to settle down somehwere and find some peace, personally.~
@626  = ~I don't know, really. I've grown fond of the open road.~
@627  = ~I haven't given it much thought. Been too busy with the day-to-day struggle to survive.~
@628  = ~But don't you feel the need to find a home, a safe place where you can settle down and be happy?~
@629  = ~I find my happiness in adventure, in exploration, in testing the limits of the world.~
@630  = ~"Home" is a fleeting illusion - I learned that long ago, in a place called Candlekeep.~
@631  = ~I suppose I do, actually. As much fun as adventuring is, I do grow weary of a life on the road.~
@632  = ~Then we have more in common than I had thought. I also hope to settle down someday, after I retire from my service as a Talon.~
@633  = ~That surprises me. I always had the impression you were happiest on a mission, fighting evil.~
@634  = ~I'd be hapy to join you when that happens, if you would allow.~
@635  = ~I know the feeling. I just wish my circumstances made the possibility of settling down be a near-future possibility, rather than a distant one.~
@636  = ~Heh. I can certainly understand that sentiment. Hmmm... would you settle down, though, given the chance?~
@637  = ~I don't think so. I've grown fond of the road and the thrill of adventure.~
@638  = ~In a heartbeat.~
@639  = ~Good - the limits of the world seem to be actively testing you, whether you seek it or not.~
@640  = ~I've been passing the tests so far.~
@641  = ~You've been a great help through all of it, Darian.~
@642  = ~And a very handsome man's been at my side through most of it.~
@643  = ~Yes, but I'm worried about what will happen when you fail. No one wins forever, not even the gods.~
@644  = ~Relax, Darian. I'll cross that bridge when the time comes.~
@645  = ~But I've won, and I'll keep winning.~
@646  = ~Well, when I do stumble, I know I've got a good friend willing to lend a hand.~
@647  = ~Yes... you will have to. And... if I'm present, I'll help you across that bridge.~
@648  = ~Your streak won't continue forever. I just hope I'm here to help you when you do fail.~
@649  = ~Yes... you do.~
@650  = ~It is help I give gladly.~
@651  = ~Er... I will help you through whatever the future has for you.~
@652  = ~Just because your home was destroyed does not mean there is not a home out there for you.~
@653  = ~No, there is not. I walk alone.~
@654  = ~Perhaps, but not in my near future.~
@655  = ~Where? With you and your people?~
@656  = ~Then I pray you are content in that walk.~
@657  = ~But someday...~
@658  = ~Ah, no. That would be extremely inappropriate. But somewhere...~
@659  = ~I am. But my mission is to defend my home and my people. Having a home is generally prerequisite to defending one.~
@660  = ~Heh. I suppose it is at that. I'm not sure if I have a mission in life.~
@661  = ~Why, there is a hint of wit, even humor in your voice. All manner of strange things are happening - why not finding a home?~
@662  = ~A home isn't a physical place - it's the people who make a home what it is. And my home is on the road.~
@663  = ~Then I pray you will find one soon. Your life is in enough turmoil that I think a sense of purpose will bring peace to you.~
@664  = ~Heh. Why not, indeed.~
@665  = ~As insightful as ever... do I really need to tell you that you've set me thinking again? (Grins)~
@666  = ~I... I think I would enjoy that.~
@667  = ~Darian, are you blushing?~
@668  = ~Careful, my good Talon - your veil is slipping.~
@669  = ~Would you object if I kissed you now?~
@670  = ~Er... damn you...~
@671  = ~Thank you for your suggestion. I will correct the deficiency.~
@672  = ~Ah... this really isn't a good time...~
@673  = ~Oh, I think it is. (Kiss Darian)~
@674  = ~You don't know what you're missing...~
@675  = ~(You kiss Darian, and to his surprise if no one else's, he returns the gesture with passion. When you let go, he backs away, blushing furiously)~
@676  = ~... I think I'll take your word for it.~
@677  = ~Then perhaps we will find that time, together.~
@678  = ~By Aerdrie Faeyna, <CHARNAME>, what happened to you?!~
@679  = ~I... I think Irenicus took something from me. Something important.~
@680  = ~I'm... not sure. But something's missing.~
@681  = ~N-Nothing... I'll be fine.~
@682  = ~Something about you changed while we were unconscious. I can't put my finger on it, but you've somehow become much darker - almost hollow, somehow.~
@683  = ~Darian... I think he took my soul.~
@684  = ~It's my soul that's changed - I don't have mine anymore.~
@685  = ~Or something's been brought to the surface. Darian, I think my soul's gone.~
@686  = ~No, you won't be. I can see it in your eyes, hear it in your voice - you lost something. Something very important. You've changed, and not for the better.~
@687  = ~I think... I think he took my soul, Darian.~
@688  = ~I'm not sure, but I think that ritual drained me of my soul.~
@689  = ~Your... your soul? By Aerdrie Faeyna, why does fate keep punishing you?! You've done nothing to deserve this! If there is absolutely anything I can do to help you, I will do it.~
@690  = ~This isn't like you, Darian. Why are you so concerned about me?~
@691  = ~And here we go again. Just why do you care so much about what happens to me?~
@692  = ~Thank you, Darian, but... why are you so concerned about me?~
@693  = ~Because I care about you, damn it! You've forced me to rethink a great many things, and I didn't want to admit I might have feelings for a <PRO_RACE>!~
@694  = ~Heh. It took me losing my soul to get you to admit you have feelings for me.~
@695  = ~Darian, I'm so sorry, but I think of you as a friend. A good friend, a steadfast friend to be sure, but nothing more.~
@696  = ~Oh, this is fun. You're finally bending down to admit you care about me when I lose my soul? You really think I'm that desperate?~
@697  = ~As... as you wish. I will stand by you if you need help, <CHARNAME>... from a friend.~
@698  = ~I... I think we've spoken enough.~
@699  = ~...Yes. You are the closest friend I have ever known. I would not have believed I could say such things to you, but here we are. Whatever happens, whatever comes, I'll be here for you, <CHARNAME>, no matter the cost to myself.~
@700  = ~I think that's actually the sweetest thing I've ever heard.~
@701  = ~And I thank you for it. I just pray it won't be necessary.~
@702  = ~That's good enough for me. Let's get going.~
@703  = ~There... there are times for such things.~
@704  = ~And I will pray for that as well.~
@705  = ~(As your eyes adjust to the sun again, you notice as Darian drops the invisibility wards on his wings and abruptly leaps into the air, his normally guarded composure a thing of the past. He seems extraordinarily thrilled to be out of the Underdark)~
@706  = ~Hehe. You sure look happy.~
@707  = ~That's abnormal behavior, to say the least. What brought this on?~
@708  = ~Who are you, and what have you done with Darian?~
@709  = ~Darian, lay off the potions. They're clearly not good for you.~
@710  = ~This has got to be the most inept doppleganger I have ever seen.~
@711  = ~I don't think I've ever seen you look so happy, Darian.~
@712  = ~Ah... I'm deeply sorry for giving in to impulse like that. It simply feels wonderful to be back in the open air again after so long in the Underdark. I thought I would lose control if I was in there much longer.~
@713  = ~You're not the only one feeling a little impulsive today. (Kiss Darian)~
@714  = ~So the big winged elf isn't so tough, after all, eh?~
@715  = ~You know, it would have been rather amusing if you had.~
@716  = ~Don't worry, I know how you feel.~
@717  = ~(Darian's face turns the most brilliant shade of red you have ever seen, but slowly and tenderly returns your kiss. As you part, his affection for you is plain to see)~
@718  = ~Sigh... I'm extremely claustrophobic, like virtually all Menel'Quessir - I'm accustomed to flying above the land, not crawling under it. My training allowed me to keep it under control, but it just felt incredible to be back in the open air.~
@719  = ~Well, it is good to see you can relax from time to time.~
@720  = ~Going crazy in the air is a good start. A little more work, and you'll be perfect.~
@721  = ~You can drop the tightrope act around me, Darian. I've seen your relaxed side.~
@722  = ~Perhaps after we free your soul, we'll all be able to relax more often.~
@723  = ~You are insane, even for a <PRO_RACE>. But I suppose it's an insanity I'll have to get used to.~
@724  = ~Even if we're now far outside the scope of my original mission, I'm still on assignment. Perhaps after we've gotten this over and done with...~
@725  = ~Yes, I'm sure it would have provided you with no end of entertainment.~
@726  = ~You're entertaining enough as it is, in a strange sort of way.~
@727  = ~Don't worry, I have plans enough for entertainment...~
@728  = ~Then indulge me.~
@729  = ~Yes, you seem to find me quite entertaining. Why you do, I've given up all hope of ever understanding.~
@730  = ~I'm not sure whether to shoot you or kiss you.~
@731  = ~Allow me to settle this one. (Kiss Darian)~
@732  = ~Oh, you'll probably get your wish at some point. Just not now.~
@733  = ~<CHARNAME>, could you come with me?~
@734  = ~Sure, Darian. What is it you want?~
@735  = ~No, thank you. I know you have feelings for me, but really, now is not the best time. I hope you understand.~
@736  = ~As... you wish.~
@737  = ~(You go with Darian, and soon find yourselves away from others, alone together on a grassy knoll. The forest is quiet, and the night calm) <CHARNAME>, do you know much of the elven tongue?~
@738  = ~Only a few words-most of the tomes at Candlekeep were either in common, or in various bizarre languages only a handful of scholars can read.~
@739  = ~Very little. I was always curious about my elven heritage, but there simply wasn't much opportunity to learn.~
@740  = ~Can't say that I do. I was raised speaking common.~
@741  = ~Heh. I was taught common, along with Auran, Draconic, and a few other languages as part of my training - better to learn the language of the enemy, so you can understand and destroy them more readily. It is still uncomfortable on my tongue, harsh and guttural.~
@742  = ~Would you be willing to teach me some of the elven language?~
@743  = ~I would like to learn some of the elven tongue, if you are willing.~
@744  = ~Gladly. (He points at himself): Menel'Quessir.~
@745  = ~And that means "Elf"?~
@746  = ~Does that mean "Avariel"?~
@747  = ~"Man"?~
@748  = ~Do you mean "Talon"?~
@749  = ~Not too far off. It is the name we, whom you call the Avariel, use for ourselves. A literal translation would be 'People of the Sky'. (He points at you): Edainme.~
@750  = ~"Woman"?~
@751  = ~"Adventurer"?~
@752  = ~"Heroine"?~
@753  = ~"Godchild"?~
@754  = ~Corect. A literal translation would be 'People of the Sky' - it is the name we use for ourselves. (He points at you): Edainme.~
@755  = ~Yes. (This continues for some time, as Darian teaches you the elven words for the forest and much within it, time itself seemingly stopped as you sit together. Eventually, he lifts his gaze upwards to the tranquil, clear night sky) Tirion.~
@756  = ~Are you referring to the night itself?~
@757  = ~The heavens?~
@758  = ~Do you speak of the stars?~
@759  = ~Not quite - 'edainme' is our word for "woman". (This continues for some time, as Darian teaches you the elven words for the forest and much within it, time itself seemingly stopped as you sit together. Eventually, he lifts his gaze upwards to the tranquil, clear night sky) Tirion.~
@760  = ~Yes, but no. It is a constellation my people call the Watchtower - very rarely visible completely, but it is tonight. (He takes your hand in his, and traces the pattern of stars across the sky) When it is visible completely, it is said to be an omen of rebirth and revelation, analkimalqua amin.~
@761  = ~What does "analkimalqua amin" mean?~
@762  = ~That elven phrase you just said - what's it mean?~
@763  = ~What did you just say? "Analkimalqua amin"?~
@764  = ~It means... my radiant swan.~
@765  = ~That's incredibly sweet of you, Darian. I didn't know you had it in you.~
@766  = ~Such a beautiful phrase... I wasn't expecting something like that from you.~
@767  = ~How touching... I couldn't have guessed you could be so poetic.~
@768  = ~Kinda cheesy, but I appreciate the thought.~
@769  = ~I'm worried, analkimalqua amin. I'm worried about you. We've purged the Realms of Bodhi, but Irenicus and your soul are still in question. A threat to myself, I can handle, but a threat to you... I would give anything, even my own life, to spare you from what has happened and what I fear is going to happen.~
@770  = ~I'm worried, too, Darian. What brought this on?~
@771  = ~For better or worse, things are switfly coming to an end.~
@772  = ~I'm confident in our ability to defeat Irenicus. We have no choice but to destroy him, so we shall.~
@773  = ~Irenicus and his plans must be stopped, Darian - you know this.~
@774  = ~Indeed they are, and all too swiftly. But... I do not want to see you be hurt any further by that, that uuvanimo!~
@775  = ~And that word, I do recognize. Irenicus is a monster, yes, but why are you reacting so badly now?~
@776  = ~We've fought him before, Darian. Why do you care so much about my well-being now?~
@777  = ~I cannot allow him to hurt others, and you know this. Why do I cause you such distress now?~
@778  = ~But... he has your soul. He fight with your strength, kills with your power! I have seen firsthand what you are capable of, and it frightens me. And I do not want you to be hurt in this final battle.~
@779  = ~We fight because we must, Darian. What makes this fight so special?~
@780  = ~It's a fight like any other, though granted, the stakes are far higher. Why are things so different now?~
@781  = ~As touching as this is, why are you so emotional?~
@782  = ~I do. But I also know that I can't bear the thought of you being injured or worse in the storm that approaches.~
@783  = ~A storm it is, but a storm we must break. And why are you so concerned about me now?~
@784  = ~The storm front may be upon us, but why are you so distressed now?~
@785  = ~We will weather this storm together, as we have weathered so many others. What makes this coming battle so different?~
@786  = ~Because amin... amin... amin mela Ile, <CHARNAME>. I love you. With all my heart, all my soul.~
@787  = ~I... I love you, too, Darian.~
@788  = ~Took you long enough to say it. (Grin) And I love you, too.~
@789  = ~Somehow, I know you'd be saying those words sooner or later. I've been deeply in love with you for some time.~
@790  = ~I... I am so sorry, Darian. I care about you, but as a brother, not a lover.~
@791  = ~(Darian suddenly gets up and walks away, leaving you alone in the night)~
@792  = ~Mela... love... I've thought about that word for a long time. It, and you, have frightened me more than all the horrors of the Underdark. Yet it feels... right. I... I've never done this before, but...~
@793  = ~<CHARNAME>... melamin... would you stay with me tonight?~
@794  = ~I will, my love.~
@795  = ~I love you, but now is not the time.~
@796  = ~(No more words pass between you. None have to.)~
@797  = ~As you wish, melamin.~
@798  = ~(You pause in your travels momentarily)~
@799  = ~(Darian's eyes sweep over the party, ever-searching for signs of danger. His eyes linger on you for a moment, an apprehensive look on his features, then they travel onward, vigilant of potential danger)~
@800  = ~(You notice that as he walks, Darian's eyes seem clouded, lost in thought. Unconsciously, his eyes turn towards you, before he abruptly turns his head to keep his eyes on the road)~
@801  = ~(You stumble over a rock as you walk, but a hand is automatically on your shoulder, steadying your stride. However as soon as you turn to face him, Darian quickly withdraws his arm, his expression unreadable)~
@802  = ~(The party takes a short break, and you notice Darian's gaze on you as he writes in a small book. He seems unaware of your attention, occupied with whatever he is writing, and a look of puzzlement dawns on his face as he writes)~
@803  = ~(A sneaking suspicion you're being watched, you abruptly turn to face Darian. His expression is carefully guarded, but he can't entirely erase a hint of red to his features)~
@804  = ~(As you walk, Darian begins to softly sing an elven melody. Though you can't pick out more than a few words of the song, your ears distinctly notice your own name amongst the notes)~
@805  = ~(Picking up your equipment after a brief rest, you find amongst your gear a beautiful necklace of feathers. You don't know how it got there, but although it is but a simple gift, you can tell if was carefully and tenderly made)~
@806  = ~(The heat of the day bears down on you, but there is suddenly a cooling breeze. You look around, and notice Darian, his eyes closed in concentration)~
@807  = ~(You feel something light brush across your shoulder, almost tickling you. Looking around, you see Darian standing near you. Though his wings are still concealed, he seems to be stretching them, and he deliberately avoids your gaze.)~
@808  = ~(Once again, you notice Darian's concerned gaze resting upon you. He doesn't need to say anything to let you know he's worried about you)~
@809  = ~(Your stride falters as your body is wracked by the emptiness of your soul. Before you can fall, Darian takes you in his arms and supports you until the attack passes)~
@810  = ~(As the party pauses briefly, Darian walks over to you with a hint of a smile on his face. In his hand is a line of beautiful feathers, which he skillfully weaves into your hair. Although clearly uncomfortable with being so forward, he does not leave your side)~
@811  = ~(The air has been growing cold in the last few hours, but as you shiver slightly, Darian walks over and wraps his cloak around you, and you feel noticeably more warm. Whether from the cloak or the man, you're not sure.)~
@812  = ~(A feeling you're being watched, you turn to Darian. His eyes are distant, once again lost in thought, but when they meet your gaze, a smile touches his face)~
@813  = ~(While scrounging in your pack, you are surprised to find something you don't recall seeing before-a beautiful piece of wood onto which has been engraved your likeness. The work isn't the best you've ever seen, but the ornate craftsmanship and elven marks leave little doubt as to who created it)~
@814  = ~(As you walk, you accidentally step on something sharp and make a soft sound of alarm. No sooner do you do so than Darian is at your side, assuming a protective position. He smiles as he applies a minor healing incantation to your foot)~
@815  = ~(Darian's hand finds yours as you walk, and he abruptly draws you into his arms. There is strength in his embrace, but also a surprising gentleness. He holds you as though you are a priceless and delicate treasure, and as you relax into the embrace, his eyes search the horizon, determined to keep you safe.)~
@816  = ~(You look at Darian, the Avariel warrior. He doesn't seem to be aware of your gaze)~
@817  = ~Can I ask you something about yourself?~
@818  = ~Darian, can we talk?~
@819  = ~(Draw closer to Darian)~
@820  = ~(Silently back off)~
@821  = ~(You back away from Darian, but he turns and looks at you warily as you do so)~
@822  = ~If you wish.~
@823  = ~(Ask Darian a silly question)~
@824  = ~(Ask Darian a more serious question)~
@825  = ~(Darian looks at you expectantly)~
@826  = ~What is your favorite color?~
@827  = ~What do you like to do in your spare time?~
@828  = ~Do you know any poetry?~
@829  = ~Do you like to sing or dance at all?~
@830  = ~Did you ever have a pet back in Myrrhavin?~
@831  = ~Does this outfit make me look fat?~
@832  = ~How old are you?~
@833  = ~Are your wings ticklish at all?~
@834  = ~Who's your favorite person in the world?~
@835  = ~Who's your least favorite person in the world?~
@836  = ~What is a Talon, exactly?~
@837  = ~Do the Avariel practice bonding rituals like other elven races?~
@838  = ~I hope you don't mind me asking, but have you ever been in love before?~
@839  = ~What's your home city of Myrrhavin like?~
@840  = ~What are the most important things in life, to you?~
@841  = ~How do you measure the value of someone?~
@842  = ~What can change the nature of a man?~
@843  = ~The human equivalent of the Talon Order would be the order of nim-ohtari, I suppose. Paladins. However, we are not bound by rules of chivalry or honor. Our duty is to defend our people at any cost - including our conscience if need be.~
@844  = ~Yes.~
@845  = ~No.~
@846  = ~Compared to a human city... you would find it sprawling, very open and airy, with no place you cannot stretch your wings. It is not only designed for beauty, however. Myrrhavin is extremely heavily fortified, and we will exact a terrible price for every inch of the city.~
@847  = ~Duty, first and foremost. And for me, that duty is the defense of my people. Secondary to that come honesty, loyalty, perseverance. Do not expect anything profoundly insightful, <CHARNAME>. I am a simple man when it comes to my values.~
@848  = ~I judge people by their actions. Not their thoughts, not their words, but their actions. A man can say anything he wants, but unless he is willing to put action to those words, they are without meaning.~
@849  = ~I am not certain if a man's basic nature can be changed. But how one reacts to his nature can be shaped by many things. Anything can shape a man, so long as he is capable of believing in it. Belief is what changes a man.~
@850  = ~Light blue, I think.~
@851  = ~I actually am fond of woodcarving of sorts in my spare time. It's an easy hobby to maintain while alone in the wild.~
@852  = ~Poetry is beautiful, but nothing worth memorizing. I tend to have more practical things to spend my time on.~
@853  = ~On occassion. And no, not in your presence.~
@854  = ~No, the Menel'Quessir do not believe in imprisoning animals. However, many succeeding generations of sparrows nested in the eaves of my home, and I was fond of them.~
@855  = ~I refuse to answer on the grounds you may kill me no matter how I answer.~
@856  = ~Around a hundred and twenty one years of age. For a human, that is perhaps equivalent to being eighteen.~
@857  = ~That is none of your concern.~
@858  = ~The person I hold in highest regard is my father, back home in Myrrhavin.~
@859  = ~There is one entity in particular I have a poor history with-a powerful elemental entity called a tempest. Living storms, as they are more often called, are normally mindless, destructive entities, but this one was very intelligent, and enjoyed a privileged relationship with my superiors. Despite my best efforts, I was never able to determine the exact nature of that relationship, or why it was in Myrrhavin at all, let alone tolerated. However, it did make some things plain-it knew far more about me than it possibly could, and more than once it has appeared without warning to wreak havoc.~
@860  = ~(Darian's eyes turn towards you. He appears to be waiting for you to take action.)~
@861  = ~(Try to catch Darian's gaze)~
@862  = ~(Try to take Darian's hand)~
@863  = ~(Approach Darian more closely)~
@864  = ~(Darian's eyes flicker in your direction. He's aware of your attention)~
@865  = ~(Grin mischieviously at him)~
@866  = ~(Blush at his attention)~
@867  = ~(Make an easygoing smile)~
@868  = ~(Pause for a moment, then reluctantly smile)~
@869  = ~(Darian returns your gaze with a slight smile)~
@870  = ~(Darian turns away from you, but there is a tinge of red to his face)~
@871  = ~(Darian frowns, and turns away)~
@872  = ~(Darian seems puzzled, and frowns)~
@873  = ~(Darian smiles as he returns your gaze)~
@874  = ~(Darian blushes slightly as he smiles in return)~
@875  = ~(You take Darian's hand in yours, but there is a great deal of tension, and Darian's eyes narrow at you)~
@876  = ~(Try to ease the tension)~
@877  = ~(Just hold his hand softly)~
@878  = ~(Move Darian's hand towards your body)~
@879  = ~(Grin and squeeze Darian's hand as hard as you can)~
@880  = ~(Darian frowns as you try to make him more at ease, and wordlessly withdraws his hand)~
@881  = ~(Darian's face remains opaque, but he does relax the tension ever-so-slightly)~
@882  = ~(There is an almost imperceptible smile on Darian's face, and he slowly relaxes his hand)~
@883  = ~(Darian doesn't respond, but nor does he withdraw his hand)~
@884  = ~(A puzzled frown comes over Darian, but he does relax fractionally)~
@885  = ~(As soon as you try to move his hand towards you, Darian snaps his hand away from you)~
@886  = ~(Darian blushes as he realizes your intentions, and removes his hand before things go any further)~
@887  = ~(Although Darian does a poor job of concealing his tension, he allows you to continue until you touch his hand to your skin, at which point he abruptly withdraws his hand and turns away from you, blushing)~
@888  = ~Very funny, <CHARNAME>. (Darian withdraws his hand)~
@889  = ~(Darian sighs good-naturedly as he realizes your intentions, and lets you continue until the pressure grows painful, and withdraws his hand)~
@890  = ~I suppose you are trying to be funny? You're not.~
@891  = ~Not amusing, <CHARNAME>.~
@892  = ~(You easily take Darian's hand in yours, and there is a hint of a smile on his face as he wonders what you're about to do)~
@893  = ~(Just hold his hand)~
@894  = ~(Move his hand towards your body)~
@895  = ~(Darian holds your hand with a surprising strength. His warm gaze confirms he is no longer afraid of his feelings for you)~
@896  = ~(Darian's hand relaxes into yours, and you enjoy a brief, tranquil moment together.)~
@897  = ~(Darian tenses for a moment, but smiles as he relaxes)~
@898  = ~(Darian flinches slightly as you move his hand to you, and his look is apprehensive, but he does not withdraw)~
@899  = ~(Though clearly uneasy with you being so physical, Darian allows you free reign to continue as you move his hand to your body and across it)~
@900  = ~(Darian quickly withdraws his hand as he realizes what you were about to do. He blushes heavily and smiles)~
@901  = ~I am sorry, but now is really not the best time for that. (Withdraws his hand)~
@902  = ~(Darian doesn't say a word, but from his posture, he is clearly aware that you're up to something)~
@903  = ~(Run your fingers through his hair)~
@904  = ~(Try to tickle his wings)~
@905  = ~(Run the tips of your fingers down his back)~
@906  = ~(Darian grows even more uneasy, but he does not interfere as you continue to run your fingers through his windblown hair)~
@907  = ~(No sooner do your fingers touch his hair than Darian steps away, blushing slightly)~
@908  = ~(Darian stops your hand before it even reaches his hair, and slowly walks away)~
@909  = ~Don't even think about it, <CHARNAME>.~
@910  = ~(You softly run your fingers through Darian's hair. The white-blue strands are disorderly, but it occurs to you that a being native to the skies probably cares little for the state of his hair)~
@911  = ~(The instant you touch his wings, Darian abruptly turns around to face you. There is a hint of red to his features as he walks away)~
@912  = ~(Sensing your motion, Darian quickly steps away as you approach.)~
@913  = ~(As soon as your fingers touch the feathery down on his back, Darian turns around and removes your hand, unaware that he's blushing heavily)~
@914  = ~(Darian flinches as you begin to tickle him, and he makes a strangled noise as you launch your attack. Judging by his laughing as you tickle his wings, you get the impression his wings are sensitive indeed, and press the assault)~
@915  = ~(You begin to tickle Darian's wings. He abruptly recoils as your fingers touch the base of his wings, and laughs. Grinning, he fully unfolds his wings and brushes the wingtips against your back, tickling you in return with great precision. You both begin to laugh, only to abruptly stop as you notice the rest of the party staring at you)~
@916  = ~<CHARNAME>, this really isn't the best time for something like that...~
@917  = ~(Despite the tension, Darian allows you to proceed. You run the tips of your fingers across his skin, which is softer than you had expected. As your hands move down to his back, you are surprised to find a coat of fine feathers extending all the way to the base of his neck. The feathers are as white as freshly fallen snow, and very soft. However, as soon as you find his folded wings, Darian turns and stops you wordlessly)~
@918  = ~(Darian very hesitantly refuses to react as you run your fingers across his back. His skin is soft and cool to the touch, though he shivers slightly as your touch. As your fingers move down his side, you find the hard line of an old scar. However, Darian abruptly steps away from you, ending your ruminations.)~
@919  = ~What do you wish, <CHARNAME>?~
@920  = ~Darian, I think there's something you should know about my past relationships.~
@921  = ~Could you tell me about the Seldarine?~
@922  = ~What about it?~
@923  = ~Darian... I've never been in one before.~
@924  = ~I've certainly dated and flirted, but I've never been in a real relationship before.~
@925  = ~I think you should know I've been deeply in love before.~
@926  = ~I am... or was, depending on how you look at it, betrothed to a man already.~
@927  = ~Darian, I'm married.~
@928  = ~I've never had feelings before... for a man.~
@929  = ~As much as I've been told I'm loved, I've never felt an actual emotional attachment to a man.~
@930  = ~That's not what I expected. Have you honestly never even been in a semi-romantic relationship with anyone?~
@931  = ~No. I've always been a solitary person-never felt the urge to get close to anyone before.~
@932  = ~I was too shy as a girl. There was a boy or two I liked, but I've never been able to actually approach anyone before.~
@933  = ~Well, I once had a really big crush on a boy, but I could never work up the nerve to talk to him.~
@934  = ~That's understandable enough, but I hope you know what you're doing. A relationship is far more complex than your studies might indicate.~
@935  = ~I find that hard to imagine. But I hope you're prepared for what may come-a relationship is not an easy thing.~
@936  = ~A first, youthful love. Amongst my people, it's seen as a good thing to get it out and over with, but apparently yours are different. I hope you're ready for the future-relationships are complicated things.~
@937  = ~To be honest, neither have I. But was there something else you wanted to say?~
@938  = ~You're not like any boyfriend I've had before. You're very different.~
@939  = ~As much as I liked to flirt, I never let myself get too close to anyone.~
@940  = ~No, but thanks for listening to me.~
@941  = ~As are you quite different from any women I've been friendly with before. It would appear the blind are leading the blind...~
@942  = ~Perhaps... perhaps you were simply awaiting the right person... perhaps I was, as well.~
@943  = ~It was no problem.~
@944  = ~I'm not surprised. Would you mind explaining?~
@945  = ~I was in love with a man once. We ended up going our separate ways, in the end.~
@946  = ~I did love someone else, but I'm afraid he died.~
@947  = ~As much as I might carry someone else's torch, Darian, I haven't seen him for a long time now.~
@948  = ~I am sorry to hear that. I... understand, if you don't wish to continue our relationship.~
@949  = ~Why would I want that? My past relationship has no bearing on ours.~
@950  = ~I like you, Darian, and I certainly don't want to end our relationship.~
@951  = ~Perhaps... that would be for the best.~
@952  = ~I simply didn't want to reopen old emotional wounds. But if you insist, we continue, I suppose I'll oblige. (Darian grins)~
@953  = ~If that is truly your wish, I will honor it.~
@954  = ~Then I apologize if I was... untoward. I did not wish to interfere with your love.~
@955  = ~Darian... I haven't seen him in a long time. I think I had best start anew.~
@956  = ~You did nothing wrong, but I would prefer if we keep things just friendly from here on out.~
@957  = ~You're... betrothed?~
@958  = ~I was. He... he died.~
@959  = ~Yes, but it isn't a matter of love. It's a matter of convenience and practicality.~
@960  = ~But I haven't seen my fiance for a long time, Darian. Not since Baldur's Gate.~
@961  = ~Then I will not intrude on your grief.~
@962  = ~No, Darian, I welcome your company.~
@963  = ~It's quite alright. You've helped me come to terms with, and move past, my grief.~
@964  = ~Thank you.~
@965  = ~I am relieved. I didn't want to seem improper.~
@966  = ~I am glad I was able to help, <CHARNAME>, and I am glad you've moved past your grief.~
@967  = ~I will take my leave of you, then.~
@968  = ~I am deeply sorry. Is there no recourse in the matter?~
@969  = ~I am afraid not.~
@970  = ~I do not know. I want to be with you, but...~
@971  = ~It doesn't matter. We're here, together.~
@972  = ~Then I will not make a mess of things for you.~
@973  = ~Well, let's just see what comes, I suppose.~
@974  = ~There is that. And together, I hope we'll remain.~
@975  = ~I'm sorry for being improper, then.~
@976  = ~No harm, no foul.~
@977  = ~I don't know where he is, but you're here. Now.~
@978  = ~If he hasn't returned yet... I don't think he ever will. But you are here.~
@979  = ~As improper as this is, if you truly wish to continue, I will.~
@980  = ~Yes, Darian. Please.~
@981  = ~I don't think it's necessary.~
@982  = ~If you are certain...~
@983  = ~Then I apologize for being improper. (Begins to turn away from you)~
@984  = ~Darian, I'm... a widow.~
@985  = ~It's not a true marriage, Darian. There's no love in it, no happiness.~
@986  = ~Yes, but I don't want to lose you, Darian.~
@987  = ~It was no problem, but perhaps it is better if we discontinue our relationship.~
@988  = ~I am deeply sorry. My... my people do not recognize human marriages, and if you wish to continue our... relationship, I would like to do so.~
@989  = ~I'd like that as well.~
@990  = ~No, perhaps it would be for the best if we part ways.~
@991  = ~We'll see what tomorrow brings, then.~
@992  = ~You won't lose me, <CHARNAME>. As long as you wish me here, I will remain.~
@993  = ~I do wish you here, Darian.~
@994  = ~Perhaps we should end our relationship. I think it's gone too far.~
@995  = ~I beg your pardon?~
@996  = ~It's the truth, Darian. I always preferred my own gender until I met you.~
@997  = ~I've laid with another in bed before, yes, but with a woman, not a man.~
@998  = ~Darian... Imoen and I were lovers for a long time.~
@999  = ~I... I'm not sure what to say. The idea that you've... that's... that's something new.~
@1000 = ~You don't need to worry about that, though. You've pulled strings in my heart in a way no woman could.~
@1001 = ~No need to be shy. Technically, I'm still a virgin when it comes to men.~
@1002 = ~It's a rather liberating perspective, but with you, being weighed down seems like a pleasant alternative.~
@1003 = ~The idea that you've... this is going to take some getting used to...~
@1004 = ~What are you implying?~
@1005 = ~I've had many lovers, Darian, but I never felt close to any of them. They weren't even true relationships.~
@1006 = ~I've become quite proficient in the bedchamber over the years, Darian. It's really quite enjoyable.~
@1007 = ~I've always been able to use my looks and my body to get what I want.~
@1008 = ~You mean... you've slept with many men?~
@1009 = ~That a problem?~
@1010 = ~Why do you care how many men I've slept with?~
@1011 = ~I'm no wide-eyed maiden, that's for sure.~
@1012 = ~Aerdrie Faeyna's the goddess of fertility isn't she? If anything, I'd imagine you'd be supportive of me.~
@1013 = ~I don't like this at all, but... I suppose I do trust you.~
@1014 = ~The very concept is appalling to me, but... I do trust you, so I suppose I must accept it.~
@1015 = ~You... I don't know why I still trust you. But I do.~
@1016 = ~Let's just   SAY that not even followers of Hanali Celanil embrace that particular aspect of fertility with such... enthusiasm.~
@1017 = ~Ah... I have no idea how to respond to that.~
@1018 = ~Allow me to show you...~
@1019 = ~I don't know... responding properly might be a bit naughtier than you're ready for right now.~
@1020 = ~Just keep blushing till your face is red as a Thayvian wizard's robes.~
@1021 = ~(Darian backs away nervously, blushing furiously)~
@1022 = ~In that... you are probably correct.~
@1023 = ~Ah... it would appear I have little choice in the matter.~
@1024 = ~As much as I would like to   SAY your charms are wasted on me... that wouldn't be entirely accurate.~
@1025 = ~A broad topic, but the Seldarine are the elven gods. Of them, however, the Menel'Quessir follow but one-Aerdrie Faeyna.~
@1026 = ~Why don't you worship any others of the Seldarine?~
@1027 = ~Is there any particular reason you follow Aerdrie Faeyna?~
@1028 = ~Are the Talons a fighting order devoted to Aerdrie Faeyna, then?~
@1029 = ~Could you tell me more about Aerdrie Faeyna?~
@1030 = ~Can you tell me something of who each of the Seldarine is?~
@1031 = ~We do venerate the others of the Seldarine, but we do not follow them, as it were. During the collapse of our civilization, we prayed to all of the Seldarine for salvation. Of them, however, only Aerdrie Faeyna answered.~
@1032 = ~Is that why you worship Aerdrie Faeyna alone of the Seldarine? She saved your race from destruction?~
@1033 = ~But what if the rest of the Seldarine were simply supporting Aerdrie Faeyna, and did in fact help save your people?~
@1034 = ~Surely you nonetheless worship at least Corellon Lotharion, though?~
@1035 = ~Yes. We are her children, and she is the sole reason we survive yet.~
@1036 = ~The possibility occurred to the long-ago priests as well, but the other Seldarine gave no hint that they were even aware of our plight. If they did support Aerdrie Faeyna's work, they gave no sign, and hence we owe them nothing.~
@1037 = ~We revere him as the father of the elven races, but there are no priests of Corellon Lotharian amongst the Menel'Quessir. For all we know, he passively condoned the annihilation of our people, and that has left a mark, <CHARNAME>, one even thousands of years will not erase.~
@1038 = ~When our civilization collapsed long ago, the ancient Menel'Quessiri priests prayed to the Seldarine for salvation. Of them, only Aerdrie Faeyna answered.~
@1039 = ~As you would understand it, yes. We are deeply devoted to the defense of the Menel'Quessir, but in our culture, dedication to our people is dedication to the Winged Mother.~
@1040 = ~The Winged Mother is a goddess primarily concerned with air, the weather, and fertility. She is regarded as being whimsical and unpredictable, even by other members of the Seldarine, but she watches over the Menel'Quessir vigilantly.~
@1041 = ~A fertility goddess? You're devoted to a fertility goddess?~
@1042 = ~Why do you follow her so? Her personality seems at odds with you and your people.~
@1043 = ~I've never really experienced praying to one of the Seldarine as an elf does... might I join you the next time you pray?~
@1044 = ~Fertility is but one aspect of the Winged Mother, but in that aspect she has blessed the Menel'Quessir since our fall. It is not, however, the aspect I most venerate.~
@1045 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but prayer is a private thing, and I will not share it with you.~
@1046 = ~If you wish to join me in my evening prayers, you are welcome to, but I do not know what you are expecting-prayer is not a spectator sport, as they say.~
@1047 = ~It was nothing.~
@1048 = ~If you wish. The Seldarine consists of Corellon Lotharian, Angharradh, Erevan Illesere, Aerdrie Faeyna, Fenmarel Mestarine, Hanali Celanil, Labelas Enoreth, Rillifane Rallathil, Sehanine Moonbow, and Solonor Thelandira.~
@1049 = ~Tell me about Corellon Lotharian.~
@1050 = ~Tell me about Angharradh.~
@1051 = ~Tell me about Erevan Illesere.~
@1052 = ~Tell me about Aerdrie Faeyna.~
@1053 = ~Tell me about Hanali Celanil.~
@1054 = ~Tell me about Labelas Enoreth.~
@1055 = ~Tell me about Rillifane Rallathil.~
@1056 = ~Tell me about Sehanine Moonbow.~
@1057 = ~Tell me about Solonor Thelandria.~
@1058 = ~Corellon Lotharian is the creator of the elven races, who sprung from his very blood. He is the ruler of the Seldarine, and patron of the other elven races as a whole.~
@1059 = ~Could you tell me more about him?~
@1060 = ~Can I ask you about a different deity?~
@1061 = ~Thank you for sharing that.~
@1062 = ~Corellon Lotharian is a god of both magic and war, though he sat idly by as the Menel'Quessir were destroyed, despite his supposed patronage. Henceforth, we revere Aerdrie Faeyna alone as our savior.~
@1063 = ~Angharradh is a composite goddess-she is the Queen of Arvandor, but she is three separate deities as well-Aerdrie Faeyna, Hanali Celanil, and Sehanine Moonbow. Angharradh seldom acts as a single goddess.~
@1064 = ~Could you tell me more about her?~
@1065 = ~The Menel'Quessir do worship Angharradh, in a way, for Aerdrie Faeyna is a part of her. But we do not worship Angarradh as a unified whole, for her other aspects have left their rifts between themselves and the Menel'Quessir.~
@1066 = ~Erevan Illesere is the most unpredictable of the Seldarine-he is the patron of thieves, revelers, mischief-makers, and their ilk. As you might expect, the Menel'Quessir accord him little reverence.~
@1067 = ~Unpredictable and dangerous though he may be, Erevan Illesere remains fiercly devoted to the other elven races, and always returns when he is needed, save for the fall of the Menel'Quessir.~
@1068 = ~Hanali Celanil is the goddess of beauty, love, and joy. She is vain, flirtatious, and short-sighted, was responsible for driving Fenmarel Mestarine away from the Seldarine, and seldom knows when it is best not to interfere.~
@1069 = ~As you might have guessed from what I said, I have no reverence for the Heart of Gold. She is a meddler by nature, always attempting to foster love in elven hearts, even when such is not a wise course of action.~
@1070 = ~Labelas Enoreth is the god of time and history. He is a calm and patient deity, and his clergy tend to be philosophers, scholars, and teachers, passing knowledge on to the next generation.~
@1071 = ~The Menel'Quessir no longer particularly revere the Lord of the Continuum, but we heed his lessons well. In truth, if there is any other member of the Seldarine we worship, it would be Labelas Enoreth.~
@1072 = ~Rillifane Rallathil is perhaps the most serious-minded of the Seldarine, being the deity concerned first and foremost with nature in its entirety, not merely an aspect like the other Seldarine.~
@1073 = ~The Leaflord is said to be one of the oldest of the Seldarine-perhaps older even than Labelas Enoreth. He is mainly served by druids, which are virtually interchangable with clerics in most clergies.~
@1074 = ~The Lady of Dreams is the most powerful goddess in the Seldarine, said to have had an important role in creating the elves. She is the goddess of illusions, the stars, and death.~
@1075 = ~Sehanine Moonbow is a truly enigmatic goddess-she is powerful and loyal to the other elven races, especially the moon elves, but little definite is known, even by her equally secretive clergy.~
@1076 = ~Solonor Thalandira is the god of hunting, archery, and survival in the wilderness. He is revered primarily by scouts and those whom you would rangers, but has relatively little worship by other elves.~
@1077 = ~I know little of Solonor Thelandria, to be honest. He was never an important deity to the Menel'Quessir, and remains little more than another of the Seldarine in our culture.~
@1078 = ~Light on details, but it seems a sound enough plan for now. I'm almost impressed.~
@1079 = ~A secret passage to your dungeon is located on an upper level of the bastion? Human architecture is even stranger than I had thought.~
@1080 = ~Wait. This one looks... different from a normal elf. The differences are minute, and she lacks wings, but could this be the source of the rumors?~
@1081 = ~W-what rumors?~
@1082 = ~One of the Menel'Quessir imprisoned here. Judging by the stumps I can see on your back, the rumors were correct. However, this one is no longer of the Menel'Quessir. <CHARNAME>, my mission here appears to have been for nothing. What to do with her, I leave to you.~
@1083 = ~So... will you help me?~
@1084 = ~Nalia.~
@1085 = ~What?!~
@1086 = ~I do not understand your anger or your sorrow. Your father rests with whatever deity you worship, does he not?~
@1087 = ~Is that supposed to be comforting?~
@1088 = ~It is to the Menel'Quessir. Then again, what was I thinking, expecting a sensible reaction from a human?~
@1089 = ~A trade? How many strings do your 'services' come with, I wonder.~
@1090 = ~That's to your credit, n'tel'quess. Not to your master's, however.~
@1091 = ~Indeed. Pity those who actually have ill mothers, due to vermin like this.~
@1092 = ~I hope even you can sense that this thing is a malign creature. Give the word and I will strike it down.~
@1093 = ~I strongly advise we kill this thing *now*, <CHARNAME>. You can't seriously be thinking about trusting it.~
@1094 = ~I seriously doubt this is a remotely good idea, <CHARNAME>, but it is your call.~
@1095 = ~I don't think there are *any* good deeds to be done in this creature's service. Only lesser evils.~
@1096 = ~Ye don't look like any elf I ever seen, mister. How'd ye get so pale?~
@1097 = ~It's normal where I'm from.~
@1098 = ~Really? Where ye from?~
@1099 = ~You've never heard of it. Trust me.~
@1100 = ~Did you think you could hide from us here? Vermin do so love to retreat underground...~
@1101 = ~Either your leaders are incompetent or Irenicus is far more dangerous than I thought, if he could take your city. I'm not sure which troubles me more.~
@1102 = ~...And it never occurred to you that such a thing is more a danger than a help? (sigh)~
@1103 = ~Meaning he's also competent, judging by your report of the situation.~
@1104 = ~We will. You can be sure of that.~
@1105 = ~Walk with reverence? Look at this city, <CHARNAME>. It isn't contested - it's *lost*. These elves may only be my cousins, but there is only one fate for these... these monsters. And that fate is oblivion.~
@1106 = ~Darian, I don't think I've ever heard you sound so angry before.~
@1107 = ~Easy, Darian. You'll leave permanent grip marks on your weapon if you stay like that.~
@1108 = ~Then we will let none survive.~
@1109 = ~Do not tarry? Look at this city, <CHARNAME>. It isn't contested - it's *lost*. These elves may only be my cousins, but there is only one fate for these... these monsters. And that fate is oblivion.~
@1110 = ~I try not to succumb to outright anger and hatred. It's unprofessional. But seeing this... there's always time for exceptions.~
@1111 = ~Even armed, their escape won't be easy, but you've given them a fighting chance, <CHARNAME>. I salute you.~
@1112 = ~That is why most lords have military forces, which I gather you do not. You are either painfully naive or simply incompetent.~
@1113 = ~By the Winged Mother... this was not what I expected to see during my mission...~
@1114 = ~Your sense is admirable... but are we really going to let it live because of one charitable whim? Don't be fooled by its poisonous tongue, <CHARNAME>.~
@1115 = ~The Menel'Quessir are no longer your prey, dragon! For our fallen nation, for Myrrhavin, and for Aerdrie Faeyna, I will strike you down!~
@1116 = ~Humans continue to surprise me. Your kind makes some very odd decisions about what to worship as a deity.~
@1117 = ~Your god has fallen. You are next.~
@1118 = ~Shadow Thieves? I'm guessing by the name that this is not a group renowned for their selflessness and heroism.~
@1119 = ~There is something very, very old here. I... am not sure if I want to know what it is.~
@1120 = ~It is not my place to interfere with human affairs, but I don't think I can condone what's happening here.~
@1121 = ~I'm not sure this is a wise idea. Humans evidently make an industry from slavery. Purge this infestation, another will arise. Humans are a lost cause.~
@1122 = ~Call one of my kind a beast again, and you forfeit your head's affinity for your shoulders.~
@1123 = ~Your town probably deserves the attacks, in all likelihood. Let's move on, <CHARNAME>.~
@1124 = ~Erm, well, what do you say?~
@1125 = ~This one calls herself Nalia. She's been accosting everyone with a sword or looks like they can cast a spell, babbling about trolls or some such. Not my concern, however.~
@1126 = ~Fascinating, if obviously detrimental to one's sanity.~
@1127 = ~Ugh. It's utterly impossible to properly stretch one's wings on a ship. And I need a bath. Now.~
@1128 = ~What's the hurry? Surely someone here has a cure poison spell or potion available.~
@1129 = ~It is...no use, I am afraid.  I have already attempted to neutralize the poison inside me.  I...do not know...what has been done to me.  Please...I must go to my friends...~
@1130 = ~Not that it wasn't already obvious, but Irenicus needs to die, and soon. If he's aiming to join the Seldarine... we cannot let this happen.~
@1131 = ~No kidding.~
@1132 = ~So after nearly wiping out your civilization and corrupting the Tree of Life in an attempt at godhood, when your people defeated him and Bodhi, you LET THEM GO?!~
@1133 = ~Worse, your queen invoked divine power to curse them... by removing their immortality? Rather than, say, removing their magic, imprisoning them, or something else that could, oh, STOP THEM FROM DOING IT AGAIN?! Or simplest of all, you didn't simply execute them?! I don't mean to rub it in, but... words do not exist to describe how *stupid* this is.~
@1134 = ~Now if you'll excuse me, my head hurts from trying to understand all this.~
@1135 = ~We had hoped this would turn out better.  The Exile has found a way to restore himself, has made pacts with our most despised enemies, and has resumed his original plot.~
@1136 = ~To be buried alive... that never occurred to me as a way to be killed. I don't think I'm happier with that bit of learning.~
@1137 = ~Valygar is a better man than you, wizard. You're both human so that doesn't mean much, but the principle stands.~
@1138 = ~You drow really don't live up to your reputation as cunning masterminds...~
@1139 = ~A dragon, down here of all places? Silvers aren't supposed to be as malevolent as their chromatic kin, for whatever that's worth.~
@1140 = ~This sort of magic would have made my mission into Athkatla much easier. Thank you, wyrm... I think.~
@1141 = ~Congratulations, <CHARNAME>. These hill folk seem to be decent people, for humans.~
@1142 = ~At this point, I don't think Irenicus can surprise me with his depravity anymore, even bringing a damn dragon into the city...~
@1143 = ~By the Winged Mother! What the hell did Irenicus do to you?! We need to get you out of here, and soon.~
@1144 = ~You find dignity and pride in your suffering, elf, but you still suffer. Let go of your quest for a martyr's crown.~
@1145 = ~You know nothing of me or my people, human. Nor shall you ever.~
@1146 = ~You are simply incapable of letting someone have an honorable death, aren't you? If it's not resurrection, it's... this.~
@1147 = ~Ellesime's folly lay in letting you live because of the feelings she had for you. She was too weak to do what was necessary. It is time to correct her mistake.~
@1148 = ~Darian, the Avariel warrior, has never made a secret of his reservations about you and your people. Yet long after any sensible person would have declared his debt to you fulfilled, he has stood unwavering at your side.~
@1149 = ~Darian, you're an Avariel. You have your own people, your own life to return to. This hasn't ever been your fight, least of all now.~
@1150 = ~You fulfilled your debt to me a long time ago, Darian. You don't need to take it this far.~
@1151 = ~This isn't going to be easy, Darian, and I need you more than ever. Are you ready?~
@1152 = ~You look to Darian, the duty-bound Avariel with whom you have against all odds built a relationship with. He notices your gaze, and stops you before you can speak.~
@1153 = ~There is a time for talking, melamin, but this isn't that time. Not to rebel against the poets, but I believe we should save your soul and the world first, exchange emotional declarations and confessions later.~
@1154 = ~There was a time you would have had a point, <CHARNAME>. But that time is long in the past. I will stand by you to the end.~
@1155 = ~To put it bluntly, if I left now I don't think I could look myself in the mirror again. Duty if nothing else does demand I take it this far.~
@1156 = ~I am. Irenicus will not walk away from us this time.~
